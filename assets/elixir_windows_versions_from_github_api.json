        "body": "https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/12/19/elixir-v1-18-0-released/\r\n\r\nElixir v1.18 is an impressive release with improvements across the two main efforts happening within the Elixir ecosystem right now: set-theoretic types and language servers. It also comes with built-in JSON support and adds new capabilities to its unit testing library. Here is a quick break down.\r\n\r\n## Type system improvements\r\n\r\nThe most exciting change in Elixir v1.18 is type checking of function calls, alongside gradual inference of patterns and return types. To understand how this will impact your programs, consider the following code in \"lib/user.ex\":\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule User do\r\n  defstruct [:age, :car_choice]\r\n\r\n  def drive(%User{age: age, car_choice: car}, car_choices) when age >= 18 do\r\n    if car in car_choices do\r\n      {:ok, car}\r\n    else\r\n      {:error, :no_choice}\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def drive(%User{}, _car_choices) do\r\n    {:error, :not_allowed}\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nElixir's type system will infer that the `drive/2` function expects a `%User{}` struct and returns either `{:ok, dynamic()}`, `{:error, :no_choice}`, or `{:error, :not_allowed}`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following code in a separate module (either in a separate or the same file), should emit a violation, due to an invalid argument:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nUser.drive({:ok, %User{}}, car_choices)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    warning: incompatible types given to User.drive/2:\r\n\r\n        User.drive({:ok, %User{age: nil, car_choice: nil}}, car_choices)\r\n\r\n    given types:\r\n\r\n        {:ok, %User{age: nil, car_choice: nil}}, empty_list()\r\n\r\n    but expected one of:\r\n\r\n        dynamic(%User{age: term(), car_choice: term()}), dynamic()\r\n\r\n    where \"car_choices\" was given the type:\r\n\r\n        # type: empty_list()\r\n        # from: lib/foo.ex:21:17\r\n        car_choices = []\r\n\r\n    typing violation found at:\r\n    \u2502\r\n 22 \u2502     User.drive({:ok, %User{}}, car_choices)\r\n    \u2502          ~\r\n    \u2502\r\n    \u2514\u2500 lib/foo.ex:22:10: Example.run/0\r\n```\r\n\r\n> The mismatched arguments are shown in red, if your terminal supports ANSI coloring.\r\n\r\nAnd the next snippet will warn because the `:error` clause will never match, as that's not a valid return type of the `User.drive/2` call:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ncase User.drive(user, car_choices) do\r\n  {:ok, car} -> car\r\n  :error -> Logger.error(\"User cannot drive\")\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is the warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    warning: the following clause will never match:\r\n\r\n        :error\r\n\r\n    because it attempts to match on the result of:\r\n\r\n        User.drive(user, car_choices)\r\n\r\n    which has type:\r\n\r\n        dynamic({:ok, term()} or {:error, :no_choice} or {:error, :not_allowed})\r\n\r\n    typing violation found at:\r\n    \u2502\r\n 26 \u2502       :error -> Logger.error(\"User cannot drive\")\r\n    \u2502       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    \u2502\r\n    \u2514\u2500 lib/foo.ex:26: Example.run/0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details on typing inference and the trade-offs made by the Elixir team, [see our official documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.18/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html#type-inference).\r\n\r\nThere are many other improvements to the type system, which we will go in detail within the official release. Meanwhile, here is a list summary of the overall improvements done to the type system:\r\n\r\n* Type inference of patterns (typing inference of guards will be part of an upcoming release)\r\n\r\n* Type checking of all language constructs, including local and remote calls, except `for`, `with`, and closures\r\n\r\n* Type checking of all functions inlined by the compiler found in `Kernel`\r\n\r\n* Type checking of all conversion functions inlined by the compiler\r\n\r\n* [Support for tuples and lists as composite types](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/28/typing-lists-and-tuples/) as well as type checking of their basic operations\r\n\r\n* Detection of clauses and patterns that will never match from `case`, `cond`, and `=`\r\n\r\n* Detection of unused clauses in private functions\r\n\r\n## ExUnit improvements\r\n\r\nExUnit now supports parameterized tests to run the same test module multiple times under different parameters.\r\n\r\nFor example, Elixir ships a local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage called `Registry`. The registry can be partitioned and its implementation differs depending if partitioning is enabled or not. Therefore, during tests, we want to ensure both modes are exercised. With Elixir v1.18, we can achieve this by writing:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule Registry.Test do\r\n  use ExUnit.Case,\r\n    async: true,\r\n    parameterize: [\r\n      %{partitions: 1},\r\n      %{partitions: 8}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n  # ... the actual tests ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nExUnit parameterizes whole test modules. If your modules are configured to run concurrently, as above, so will the parameterized ones.\r\n\r\nExUnit also comes with the ability of specifying test groups. While ExUnit supports running tests concurrently, those tests must not have shared state between them. However, in large applications, it may be common for some tests to depend on some shared state, and other tests to depend on a completely separate state. For example, part of your tests may depend on Cassandra, while others depend on Redis. Prior to Elixir v1.18, these tests could not run concurrently, but in v1.18 they might as long as they are assigned to different groups. Tests modules within the same group do not run concurrently, but across groups, they might.\r\n\r\nWith features like async tests, suite partitioning, and now grouping, Elixir developers have plenty of flexibility to make the most use of their machine resources, both in development and in CI.\r\n\r\n## `mix format --migrate`\r\n\r\nThe `mix format` command now supports an explicit `--migrate` flag, which will convert constructs that have been deprecated in Elixir to their latest version. Because this flag rewrites the AST, it is not guaranteed the migrated format will always be valid when used in combination with macros that also perform AST rewriting.\r\n\r\nAs of this release, the following migrations are executed:\r\n\r\n  * Normalize parens in bitstring modifiers - it removes unnecessary parentheses in known bitstring modifiers, for example `<<foo::binary()>>` becomes `<<foo::binary>>`, or adds parentheses for custom modifiers, where `<<foo::custom_type>>` becomes `<<foo::custom_type()>>`.\r\n\r\n  * Charlists as sigils - formats charlists as `~c` sigils, for example `'foo'` becomes `~c\"foo\"`.\r\n\r\n  * `unless` as negated `if`s - rewrites `unless` expressions using `if` with a negated condition, for example `unless foo do` becomes `if !foo do`.\r\n\r\nMore migrations may be added in future releases.\r\n\r\n## JSON support\r\n\r\nThis release includes official support for JSON encoding and decoding.\r\n\r\nBoth encoder and decoder fully conform to [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259) and [ECMA 404](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-404/) standards.\r\n\r\n### Encoding\r\n\r\nEncoding can be done via `JSON.encode!/1` and `JSON.encode_to_iodata!/1` functions. The default encoding rules are applied as follows:\r\n\r\n| **Elixir**             | **JSON** |\r\n|------------------------|----------|\r\n| `integer() \\| float()` | Number   |\r\n| `true \\| false `       | Boolean  |\r\n| `nil`                  | Null     |\r\n| `binary()`             | String   |\r\n| `atom()`               | String   |\r\n| `list()`               | Array    |\r\n| `%{binary() => _}`     | Object   |\r\n| `%{atom() => _}`       | Object   |\r\n| `%{integer() => _}`    | Object   |\r\n\r\nYou may also implement the `JSON.Encoder` protocol for custom data structures. Elixir already implements the protocol for all Calendar types.\r\n\r\nIf you have a struct, you can derive the implementation of the `JSON.Encoder` by specifying which fields should be encoded to JSON:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  @derive {JSON.Encoder, only: [...]}\r\n  defstruct ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Decoding\r\n\r\nDecoding can be done via `JSON.decode/2` and `JSON.decode!/2` functions. The default decoding rules are applied as follows:\r\n\r\n| **JSON** | **Elixir**             |\r\n|----------|------------------------|\r\n| Number   | `integer() \\| float()` |\r\n| Boolean  | `true \\| false`        |\r\n| Null     | `nil`                  |\r\n| String   | `binary()`             |\r\n| Object   | `%{binary() => _}`     |\r\n\r\n## Language server listeners\r\n\r\n4 months ago, we welcomed [the Official Language Server team](https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2024/08/15/welcome-elixir-language-server-team/), with the goal of unifying the efforts behind code intelligence, tools, and editors in Elixir. Elixir v1.18 brings new features on this front by introducing locks and listeners to its compilation. Let's understand what it means.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, all language server implementations have their own compilation environment. This means that your project and dependencies during development are compiled once, for your own use, and then again for the language server. This duplicate effort could cause the language server experience to lag, when it could be relying on the already compiled artifacts of your project.\r\n\r\nThis release address by introducing a compiler lock, ensuring that only a single operating system process running Elixir compiles your project at a given moment, and by providing the ability for one operating system process to listen to the compilation results of others. In other words, different Elixir instances can now communicate over the same compilation build, instead of racing each other.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements do not only improve editor tooling, but they also directly benefit projects like IEx and Phoenix. For example, you can invoke `IEx.configure(auto_reload: true)` and IEx will automatically reload modules changed elsewhere, either by a separate terminal or your IDE.\r\n\r\n## Potential incompatibilities\r\n\r\nThis release no longer supports WERL (a graphical user interface on Windows used by Erlang 25 and earlier). For a better user experience on Windows terminals, use Erlang/OTP 26+ (this is also the last Elixir release to support Erlang/OTP 25).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in order to support inference of patterns, Elixir will raise if it finds recursive variable definitions. This means patterns that never match, such as this one, will no longer compile:\r\n\r\n    def foo(x = {:ok, y}, x = y)\r\n\r\nHowever, recursion of root variables (where variables directly point to each other), will also fail to compile:\r\n\r\n    def foo(x = y, y = z, z = x)\r\n\r\nWhile the definition above could succeed (as long as all three arguments are equal), the cycle is not necessary and could be removed, as below:\r\n\r\n    def foo(x = y, y = z, z)\r\n\r\nYou may also prefer to write using guards:\r\n\r\n    def foo(x, y, z) when x == y and y == z\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [CLI] Add experimental PowerShell scripts for `elixir`, `elixirc`, and `mix` on Windows.

Alternatively, you might alias the task: `aliases: [compile: \"compile --warnings-as-errors\"]`\r\n  * [mix test] `:warnings_as_errors` configuration in `:test_elixirc_options` is deprecated. Instead pass the `--warnings-as-errors` flag to `mix test`. Alternatively, you might alias the task: `aliases: [test: \"test --warnings-as-errors\"]`\r\n  * [Mix.Tasks.Compile] Deprecate `compilers/0` in favor of `Mix.Task.Compiler.compilers/0`\r\n\r\n## v1.17\r\n\r\nThe CHANGELOG for v1.17 releases can be found [in the v1.17 branch](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v1.17/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n",

        "body": "### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [CLI] Add experimental PowerShell scripts for `elixir`, `elixirc`, and `mix` on Windows. Those provide a safer entry point for running Elixir from other platforms\r\n  * [Calendar] Add `Duration.to_string/1`\r\n  * [Code] Support several migration options in `Code.format_string!/2`\r\n  * [Code] Add parenthesis around `--` and `---` in `Code.format_string!/2` to make precedence clearer\r\n  * [Code] Include more metadata in `Code.string_to_quoted/2` when `token_metadata: true` to help compute ranges from the AST\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Have `:capture_arg` as its own entry in `Code.Fragment.surround_context/2`\r\n  * [Config] Add `Config.read_config/1`\r\n  * [Enumerable] Add `Enum.product_by/2` and `Enum.sum_by/2`\r\n  * [Exception] Add `MissingApplicationsError` exception to denote missing applications\r\n  * [Kernel] Update source code parsing to match [UTS #55](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr55/) latest recommendations. In particular, mixed script is allowed in identifiers as long as they are separate by underscores (`_`), such as `http_\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u0440`. Previously allowed highly restrictive identifiers, which mixed Latin and other scripts, such as the japanese word for t-shirt, `T\u30b7\u30e3\u30c4`, now require the underscore as well\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn on bidirectional confusability in identifiers\r\n  * [Kernel] Verify the type of the binary generators\r\n  * [Kernel] Track the type of tuples in patterns and inside `elem/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Perform validation of root AST nodes in `unquote` and `unquote_splicing` to catch bugs earlier\r\n  * [Kernel] Add source, behaviour, and record information to Docs chunk metadata\r\n  * [Kernel] Support deterministic builds in tandem with Erlang by setting `ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=deterministic`. Keep in mind deterministic builds strip source and other compile time information, which may be relevant for programs\r\n  * [Kernel] Allow aliases and imports to be enabled conditionally in module body\r\n  * [List] Add `List.ends_with?/2`\r\n  * [Macro] Improve `dbg` handling of `if/2`, `with/1` and of code blocks\r\n  * [Macro] Add `Macro.struct_info!/2` to return struct information mirroring `mod.__info__(:struct)`\r\n  * [Registry] Add `Registry.lock/3` for local locking\r\n  * [PartitionSupervisor] Add `PartitionSupervisor.resize!/2` to resize the number of partitions in a supervisor (up to the limit it was started with)\r\n  * [Process] Handle arbitrarily high integer values in `Process.sleep/1`\r\n  * [Protocol] Add `@undefined_impl_description` to customize error message when an implementation is undefined\r\n  * [Protocol] Add `__deriving__/1` as optional macro callback to `Protocol`, no longer requiring empty implementations\r\n  * [String] Inspect special whitespace and zero-width characters using their Unicode representation\r\n  * [String] Update Unicode to 16.0\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Support parameterized tests on `ExUnit.Case`\r\n  * [ExUnit] Support test groups: tests in the same group never run concurrently\r\n  * [ExUnit.Case] Add `test_pid` as a tag\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx] Add `:dot_iex` support to `IEx.configure/1`\r\n  * [IEx] Add report for normal/shutdown exits in IEx\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile] Ensure only a single operating system process can compile at a given time\r\n  * [mix deps.get] Ensure only a single operating system process can fetch deps at a given time\r\n  * [mix format] Add `mix format --migrate` to migrate from deprecated functionality\r\n  * [mix format] Add new options and metadata to improve formatting applying by editors and other environments\r\n  * [mix test] Taint failure manifest if requiring or compiling tests fail\r\n  * [Mix.Project] Add a `:listeners` configuration to listen to compilation events from the current and other operating system processes\r\n  * [Mix.Task.Compiler] Add API for fetching all persisted compiler diagnostics\r\n  * [Mix.Task.Compiler] Add API for fetching all compiler tasks\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Fix delimiter metadata for single quoted atoms and remote calls in `Code.string_to_quoted/2`\r\n  * [Code.Formatter] Fix formatter adding extra escapes to quoted remote calls\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Properly handle keyword keys as their own entry\r\n  * [Inspect.Algebra] Ensure `next_break_fits` respects `line_length`\r\n  * [Kernel] Validate AST on `unquote` and `unquote_splicing` to provide better error reports instead of failing too late inside the compiler\r\n  * [Module] Include module attribute line and name when tracing its aliases\r\n  * [Stream] Do not halt streams twice in `Stream.transform/5`\r\n  * [URI] Fix a bug when a schemaless URI is given to `URI.merge/2`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Assertions] Raise if guards are used in `assert/1` with `=`\r\n  * [ExUnit.Assertions] Format inserted/deleted maps in list assertions\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx.Helpers] `IEx.Helpers.recompile/0` will reload modules changed by other operating system processes\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile] Ensure warnings from external resources are emitted with `--all-warnings` when files do not change\r\n  * [mix deps.compile] Fix escaping issues when invoking `rebar3` in some cases\r\n  * [mix escript] Fix escript layout and support storing `priv` directories\r\n  * [mix release] Make `.app` files deterministic in releases\r\n  * [Mix.Shell] Fix `Mix.Shell` on Windows when outputting non UTF-8 characters\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Inspect.Algebra] `color/3` is deprecated in favor of `color_doc/3`\r\n  * [Inspect.Algebra] `fold_doc/2` is deprecated in favor of `fold/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Deprecate `unless` in favor of `if`. Use `mix format --migrate` to automate the migration\r\n  * [Macro] `Macro.struct!/2` is deprecated in favor of `Macro.struct_info!/2`\r\n  * [Protocol] Defining `__deriving__/3` inside the `Any` implementation is deprecated, derive it inside the protocol definition itself\r\n\r\n### 4. Hard deprecations\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] `<%#` is deprecated in favor of `<%!--` or `<% #`\r\n  * [EEx] `c:EEx.handle_text/2` is deprecated in favor of `c:EEx.handle_text/3`\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Setting `:warnings_as_errors` is deprecated via `Code.put_compiler_option/2`. This must not affect developers, as the `:warnings_as_errors` option is managed by Mix tasks, and not directly used via the `Code` module\r\n  * [Enumerable] Deprecate returning a two-arity function in `Enumerable.slice/1`\r\n  * [List] `List.zip/1` is deprecated in favor of `Enum.zip/1`\r\n  * [Module] Deprecate `Module.eval_quoted/3` in favor of `Code.eval_quoted/3`\r\n  * [Range] Deprecate inferring negative ranges on `Range.new/2`\r\n  * [Tuple] `Tuple.append/2` is deprecated, use `Tuple.insert_at/3` instead\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix cmd] Deprecate `mix cmd --app APP` in favor of `mix do --app APP`\r\n  * [Mix.Tasks.Compile] Deprecate `compilers/0` in favor of `Mix.Task.Compiler.compilers/0`\r\n",

It also includes a new Duration data type to interact with Calendar types, support for Erlang/OTP 27, and many other improvements.\r\n\r\n## Warnings from gradual set-theoretic types\r\n\r\nThis release introduces gradual set-theoretic types to infer types from patterns and use them to type check programs, enabling the Elixir compiler to find faults and bugs in codebases without requiring changes to existing software. The underlying principles, theory, and roadmap of our work have been outlined in [\"The Design Principles of the Elixir Type System\" by Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, Jos\u00e9 Valim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Elixir developers will interact with set-theoretic types only through warnings found by the type system. The current implementation models all data types in the language:\r\n\r\n  * `binary()`, `integer()`, `float()`, `pid()`, `port()`, `reference()` - these types are indivisible. This means both `1` and `13` get the same `integer()` type.\r\n\r\n  * `atom()` - it represents all atoms and it is divisible. For instance, the atom `:foo` and `:hello_world` are also valid (distinct) types.\r\n\r\n  * `map()` and structs - maps can be \"closed\" or \"open\". Closed maps only allow the specified keys, such as `%{key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Open maps support any other keys in addition to the ones listed and their definition starts with `...`, such as `%{..., key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Structs are closed maps with the `__struct__` key.\r\n\r\n  * `tuple()`, `list()`, and `function()` - currently they are modelled as indivisible types. The next Elixir versions will also introduce fine-grained support to them.\r\n\r\nWe focused on atoms and maps on this initial release as they are respectively the simplest and the most complex types representations, so we can stress the performance of the type system and quality of error messages. Modelling these types will also provide the most immediate benefits to Elixir developers. Assuming there is a variable named `user`, holding a `%User{}` struct with an `address` field, Elixir v1.17 will emit the following warnings at compile-time:\r\n\r\n  * Pattern matching against a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `%{adress: ...} = user` (notice `address` vs `adress`)\r\n\r\n  * Accessing a key on a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `user.adress`\r\n\r\n  * Updating a struct or a map that does not define the given key, such as `%{user | adress: ...}`\r\n\r\n  * Invoking a function on non-modules, such as `user.address()`\r\n\r\n  * Capturing a function on non-modules, such as `&user.address/0`\r\n\r\n  * Attempting to invoke to call an anonymous function without an actual function, such as `user.()`\r\n\r\n  * Performing structural comparisons with structs, such as `my_date < ~D[2010-04-17]`\r\n\r\n  * Performing structural comparisons between non-overlapping types, such as `integer >= string`\r\n\r\n  * Building and pattern matching on binaries without the relevant specifiers, such as `<<name>>` (this warns because by default it expects an integer, it should have been `<<name::binary>>` instead)\r\n\r\n  * Attempting to rescue an undefined exception or a struct that is not an exception\r\n\r\n  * Accessing a field that is not defined in a rescued exception\r\n\r\nThese new warnings help Elixir developers find bugs earlier and give more confidence when refactoring code, especially around maps and structs. While some of these warnings were emitted in the past, they were discovered using syntax analysis. The new warnings are more reliable, precise, and with better error messages. Keep in mind, however, that the Elixir typechecker only infers types from patterns within the same function at the moment. Analysis from guards and across function boundaries will be added in future relases. For more details, see our new [reference document on gradual set-theoretic types](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html).\r\n\r\nThe type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) and [Remote](https://remote.com/). The development work is currently sponsored by [Fresha](https://www.fresha.com/), [Starfish*](https://starfish.team/), and [Dashbit](https://dashbit.co/).\r\n\r\n## Erlang/OTP support\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for Erlang/OTP 27 and drops support for Erlang/OTP 24. We recommend Elixir developers to migrate to Erlang/OTP 26 or later, especially on Windows. Support for WERL (a graphical user interface for the Erlang terminal on Windows) will be removed in Elixir v1.18.\r\n\r\n## Adding `Duration` and `shift/2` functions\r\n\r\nElixir introduces the `Duration` data type and APIs to shift dates, times, and date times by a given duration, considering different calendars and time zones.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Date.shift(~D[2016-01-31], month: 2)\r\n~D[2016-03-31]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the operation is called `shift` (instead of `add`) since working with durations does not obey properties such as associativity. For instance, adding one month and then one month does not give the same result as adding two months:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> ~D[2016-01-31] |> Date.shift(month: 1) |> Date.shift(month: 1)\r\n~D[2016-03-29]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, durations are essential for building intervals, recurring events, and modelling scheduling complexities found in the world around us. For `DateTime`s, Elixir will correctly deal with time zone changes (such as Daylight Saving Time), but provisions are also available in case you want to surface conflicts (for example, you shifted to a wall clock that does not exist, because the clock has been moved forward by one hour). See `DateTime.shift/2` for examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new `Kernel.to_timeout/1` function has been added, which helps developers normalize durations and integers to a timeout used by Process APIs. For example, to send a message after one hour, one can now write:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nProcess.send_after(pid, :wake_up, to_timeout(hour: 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## v1.17.0 (2024-06-12)\r\n\r\n### 1.

It also includes a new Duration data type to interact with Calendar types and support for Erlang/OTP 27.\r\n\r\n## Warnings from gradual set-theoretic types\r\n\r\nThis release introduces gradual set-theoretic types to infer types from patterns and guards and use them to type check programs, enabling the Elixir compiler to find faults and bugs in codebases without requiring changes to existing software. The underlying principles, theory, and roadmap of our work have been outlined in [\"The Design Principles of the Elixir Type System\" by Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, Jos\u00e9 Valim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Elixir developers will interact with set-theoretic types only through warnings found by the type system. The current implementation models all data types in the language:\r\n\r\n  * `binary()`, `integer()`, `float()`, `pid()`, `port()`, `reference()` - these types are indivisible. This means both `1` and `13` get the same `integer()` type.\r\n\r\n  * `atom()` - it represents all atoms and it is divisible. For instance, the atom `:foo` and `:hello_world` are also valid (distinct) types.\r\n\r\n  * `map()` and structs - maps can be \"closed\" or \"open\". Closed maps only allow the specified allows keys, such as `%{key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Open maps support any other keys in addition to the ones listed and their definition starts with `...`, such as `%{..., key: atom(), value: integer()}`. Structs are closed maps with the `__struct__` key.\r\n\r\n  * `tuple()`, `list()`, and `function()` - currently they are modelled as indivisible types. The next Elixir versions will also introduce fine-grained support to them.\r\n\r\nWe focused on atoms and maps on this initial release as they are respectively the simplest and the most complex types representations, so we can stress the performance of the type system and quality of error messages. Modelling these types will also provide the most immediate benefits to Elixir developers. Assuming there is a variable named `user`, holding a `%User{}` struct with an `address` field, Elixir v1.17 will emit the following warnings at compile-time:\r\n\r\n  * Pattern matching against a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `%{adress: ...} = user` (notice `address` vs `adress`)\r\n\r\n  * Accessing a key on a map or a struct that does not have the given key, such as `user.adress`\r\n\r\n  * Updating a struct or a map that does not define the given key, such as `%{user | adress: ...}`\r\n\r\n  * Invoking a function on non-modules, such as `user.address()`\r\n\r\n  * Capturing a function on non-modules, such as `&user.address/0`\r\n\r\n  * Performing structural comparisons with structs, such as `my_date < ~D[2010-04-17]`\r\n\r\n  * Performing structural comparisons between non-overlapping types, such as `integer >= string`\r\n\r\n  * Building and pattern matching on binaries without the relevant specifiers, such as `<<string>>` (this warns because by default it expects an integer)\r\n\r\n  * Attempting to rescue an undefined exception or an exception that is not a struct\r\n\r\n  * Accessing a field that is not defined in a rescued exception\r\n\r\nThese new warnings help Elixir developers find bugs earlier and give more confidence when refactoring code, especially around maps and structs. While some of these warnings were emitted in the past, they were discovered using syntax analysis. The new warnings are more reliable, precise, and with better error messages. Keep in mind that not all maps have statically known keys, and the Elixir typechecker only infers types from patterns at the moment.\r\n\r\nFuture Elixir versions will infer and type check more constructs, bringing Elixir developers more warnings and quality of life improvements without changes to code. For more details, see our new [reference document on gradual set-theoretic types](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/gradual-set-theoretic-types.html).\r\n\r\nThe type system was made possible thanks to a partnership between [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/) and [Remote](https://remote.com/). The development work is currently sponsored by [Fresha](https://www.fresha.com/), [Starfish*](https://starfish.team/), and [Dashbit](https://dashbit.co/).\r\n\r\n## Erlang/OTP support\r\n\r\nThis release adds support for Erlang/OTP 27 and drops support for Erlang/OTP 24. We recommend Elixir developers to migrate to Erlang/OTP 26 or later, especially on Windows. Support for WERL (a graphical user interface for the Erlang terminal on Windows) will be removed in Elixir v1.18.\r\n\r\n## Adding `Duration` and `shift/2` functions\r\n\r\nElixir introduces the `Duration` data type and APIs to shift dates, times, and date times by a given duration, considering different calendars and time zones.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Date.shift(~D[2016-01-31], month: 2)\r\n~D[2016-03-31]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the operation is called `shift` (instead of `add`) since working with durations does not obey properties such as associativity. For instance, adding one month and then one month does not give the same result as adding two months:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> ~D[2016-01-31] |> Date.shift(month: 1) |> Date.shift(month: 1)\r\n~D[2016-03-29]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, durations are essential for building intervals, recurring events, and modelling scheduling complexities found in the world around us. For `DateTime`s, Elixir will correctly deal with time zone changes (such as Daylight Saving Time), but provisions are also available in case you want to surface conflicts (for example, you shifted to a wall clock that does not exist, because the clock has been moved forward by one hour). See `DateTime.shift/2` for examples.\r\n\r\nFinally, a new `Kernel.to_timeout/1` function has been added, which helps developers normalize durations and integers to a timeout used by Process APIs. For example, to send a message after one hour, one can now write:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nProcess.send_after(pid, :wake_up, to_timeout(hour: 1))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1.

Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] Include relative file information in diagnostics\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Add `:emit_warnings` for `Code.string_to_quoted/2`\r\n  * [Code] Automatically include columns in parsing options\r\n  * [Code] Introduce `MismatchedDelimiterError` for handling mismatched delimiter exceptions\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Handle anonymous calls in fragments\r\n  * [Code.Formatter] Trim trailing whitespace on heredocs with `\\r\\n`\r\n  * [File] Add `:offset` option to `File.stream!/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Auto infer size of matched variable in bitstrings\r\n  * [Kernel] Preserve column information when translating typespecs\r\n  * [Kernel] Suggest module names based on suffix and casing errors when the module does not exist in `UndefinedFunctionError`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Introduce `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2` to compile multiple additional entries in parallel\r\n  * [Kernel.SpecialForms] Warn if `True`/`False`/`Nil` are used as aliases and there is no such alias\r\n  * [Macro] Add `Macro.compile_apply/4`\r\n  * [Module] Add support for `@nifs` annotation from Erlang/OTP 25\r\n  * [Module] Add support for missing `@dialyzer` configuration\r\n  * [String] Update to Unicode 15.1.0\r\n  * [String] Add `String.replace_invalid/2`\r\n  * [Task] Add `:limit` option to `Task.yield_many/2`\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n\r\n  * [Logger] Add `Logger.levels/0`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix] Add `MIX_PROFILE` to profile a list of comma separated tasks\r\n  * [mix archive.install] Support `--sparse` option\r\n  * [mix compile.app] Warn if both `:applications` and `:extra_applications` are used\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Pass original exception down to diagnostic `:details` when possible\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Optimize scenario where there are thousands of files in `lib/` and one of them is changed\r\n  * [mix deps.clean] Emit a warning instead of crashing when a dependency cannot be removed\r\n  * [mix escript.install] Support `--sparse` option\r\n  * [mix release] Include `include/` directory in releases\r\n  * [mix test] Allow testing multiple file:line at once, such as `mix test test/foo_test.exs:13 test/bar_test.exs:27`\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Keep quotes for atom keys in formatter\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Fix crash in `Code.Fragment.surround_context/2` when matching on `->`\r\n  * [IO] Raise when using `IO.binwrite/2` on terminated device (mirroring `IO.write/2`)\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not expand aliases recursively (the alias stored in Macro.Env is already expanded)\r\n  * [Kernel] Ensure `dbg` module is a compile-time dependency\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn when a private function or macro uses `unquote/1` and the function/macro itself is unused\r\n  * [Kernel] Re-enabled compiler optimizations for top level functions in scripts (disabled in v1.14.0 but shouldn't impact most programs)\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not define an alias for nested modules starting with `Elixir.` in their definition\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Consider a module has been defined in `@after_compile` callbacks to avoid deadlocks\r\n  * [Macro] Address exception on `Macro.to_string/1` for certain ASTs\r\n  * [Path] Lazily evaluate `File.cwd!/0` in `Path.expand/1` and `Path.absname/1`\r\n  * [Path] Ensure `Path.relative_to/2` returns a relative path when the given argument does not share a common prefix with `cwd`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Raise on incorrectly dedented doctests\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx.Pry] Fix prying functions with only literals in their body\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix archive.install] Restore code paths after `mix archive.install`\r\n  * [mix compile] Ensure files with duplicate modules are recompiled whenever any of the files change\r\n  * [mix compile] Update Mix compiler diagnostics documentation and typespecs to match the Elixir compiler behaviour where both lines and columns start from one (before it inaccurately said that columns started from zero)\r\n  * [mix escript.install] Restore code paths after `mix escript.install`\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [File] Deprecate `File.stream!(file, options, line_or_bytes)` in favor of keeping the options as last argument, as in `File.stream!(file, line_or_bytes, options)`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Deprecate `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.async/1` in favor of `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2`\r\n  * [Path] Deprecate `Path.safe_relative_to/2` in favor of `Path.safe_relative/2`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile] Returning a four-element tuple as a position in `Mix.Task.Compiler.Diagnostic`\r\n\r\n### 4. Hard deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Date] Deprecate inferring a range with negative step, call `Date.range/3` with a negative step instead\r\n  * [Enum] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `Enum.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n  * [Kernel] `~R/.../` is deprecated in favor of `~r/.../`. This is because `~R/.../` still allowed escape codes, which did not fit the definition of uppercase sigils\r\n  * [String] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `String.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Formatter] Deprecate `format_time/2`, use `format_times/1` instead\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile.leex] Require `:leex` to be added as a compiler to run the `leex` compiler\r\n  * [mix compile.yecc] Require `:yecc` to be added as a compiler to run the `yecc` compiler\r\n",

        "body": "## Code snippets in diagnostics\r\n\r\nElixir v1.15 introduced a new compiler diagnostic format and the ability to print multiple error diagnostics per compilation (in addition to multiple warnings).\r\n\r\nWith Elixir v1.16, we also include code snippets in exceptions and diagnostics raised by the compiler. For example, a syntax error now includes a pointer to where the error happened:\r\n\r\n```\r\n** (SyntaxError) invalid syntax found on lib/my_app.ex:1:17:\r\n    error: syntax error before: '*'\r\n    \u2502\r\n  1 \u2502 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, *]\r\n    \u2502                 ^\r\n    \u2502\r\n    \u2514\u2500 lib/my_app.ex:1:17\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor mismatched delimiters, it now shows both delimiters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n** (MismatchedDelimiterError) mismatched delimiter found on lib/my_app.ex:1:18:\r\n    error: unexpected token: )\r\n    \u2502\r\n  1 \u2502 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)\r\n    \u2502 \u2502                \u2514 mismatched closing delimiter (expected \"]\")\r\n    \u2502 \u2514 unclosed delimiter\r\n    \u2502\r\n    \u2514\u2500 lib/my_app.ex:1:18\r\n```\r\n\r\nErrors and warnings diagnostics also include code snippets. When possible, we will show precise spans, such as on undefined variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  error: undefined variable \"unknown_var\"\r\n  \u2502\r\n5 \u2502     a - unknown_var\r\n  \u2502         ^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  \u2502\r\n  \u2514\u2500 lib/sample.ex:5:9: Sample.foo/1\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise the whole line is underlined:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: function names should start with lowercase characters or underscore, invalid name CamelCase\r\n  \u2502\r\n3 \u2502   def CamelCase do\r\n  \u2502   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  \u2502\r\n  \u2514\u2500 lib/sample.ex:3\r\n```\r\n\r\nA huge thank you to Vin\u00edcius Muller for working on the new diagnostics.\r\n\r\n## Revamped documentation\r\n\r\nElixir's Getting Started guided has been made part of the Elixir repository and incorporated into ExDoc. This was an opportunity to revisit and unify all official guides and references.\r\n\r\nWe have also incorporated and extended the work on [Understanding Code Smells in Elixir Functional Language](https://github.com/lucasvegi/Elixir-Code-Smells/blob/main/etc/2023-emse-code-smells-elixir.pdf), by Lucas Vegi and Marco Tulio Valente, from [ASERG/DCC/UFMG](http://aserg.labsoft.dcc.ufmg.br/), into the official document in the form of anti-patterns. The anti-patterns are divided into four categories: code-related, design-related, process-related, and meta-programming. Our goal is to give all developers examples of potential anti-patterns, with context and examples on how to improve their codebases.\r\n\r\nAnother [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) feature we have incorporated in this release is the addition of cheatsheets, starting with [a cheatsheet for the Enum module](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/enum-cheat.html). If you would like to contribute future cheatsheets to Elixir itself, feel free to start a discussion with an issue.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have started enriching our documentation with [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) diagrams. You can find examples in the [GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/GenServer.html) and [Supervisor](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/Supervisor.html) docs.\r\n\r\n## v1.16.0-rc.0 (2023-10-31)\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] Include relative file information in diagnostics\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code] Automatically include columns in parsing options\r\n  * [Code] Introduce `MismatchedDelimiterError` for handling mismatched delimiter exceptions\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Handle anonymous calls in fragments\r\n  * [Code.Formatter] Trim trailing whitespace on heredocs with `\\r\\n`\r\n  * [Kernel] Suggest module names based on suffix and casing errors when the module does not exist in `UndefinedFunctionError`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Introduce `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2` to compile multiple additional entries in parallel\r\n  * [Kernel.SpecialForms] Warn if `True`/`False`/`Nil` are used as aliases and there is no such alias\r\n  * [Macro] Add `Macro.compile_apply/4`\r\n  * [Module] Add support for `@nifs` annotation from Erlang/OTP 25\r\n  * [Module] Add support for missing `@dialyzer` configuration\r\n  * [String] Update to Unicode 15.1.0\r\n  * [Task] Add `:limit` option to `Task.yield_many/2`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix] Add `MIX_PROFILE` to profile a list of comma separated tasks\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Optimize scenario where there are thousands of files in `lib/` and one of them is changed\r\n  * [mix test] Allow testing multiple file:line at once, such as `mix test test/foo_test.exs:13 test/bar_test.exs:27`\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Fix crash in `Code.Fragment.surround_context/2` when matching on `->`\r\n  * [IO] Raise when using `IO.binwrite/2` on terminated device (mirroring `IO.write/2`)\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not expand aliases recursively (the alias stored in Macro.Env is already expanded)\r\n  * [Kernel] Ensure `dbg` module is a compile-time dependency\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn when a private function or macro uses `unquote/1` and the function/macro itself is unused\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not define an alias for nested modules starting with `Elixir.` in their definition\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Consider a module has been defined in `@after_compile` callbacks to avoid deadlocks\r\n  * [Path] Ensure `Path.relative_to/2` returns a relative path when the given argument does not share a common prefix with `cwd`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Raise on incorrectly dedented doctests\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [Mix] Ensure files with duplicate modules are recompiled whenever any of the files change\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [File] Deprecate `File.stream!(file, options, line_or_bytes)` in favor of keeping the options as last argument, as in `File.stream!(file, line_or_bytes, options)`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] Deprecate `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.async/1` in favor of `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2`\r\n  * [Path] Deprecate `Path.safe_relative_to/2` in favor of `Path.safe_relative/2`\r\n\r\n### 4. Hard deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Date] Deprecate inferring a range with negative step, call `Date.range/3` with a negative step instead\r\n  * [Enum] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `Enum.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n  * [Kernel] `~R/.../` is deprecated in favor of `~r/.../`. This is because `~R/.../` still allowed escape codes, which did not fit the definition of uppercase sigils\r\n  * [String] Deprecate passing a range with negative step on `String.slice/2`, give `first..last//1` instead\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Formatter] Deprecate `format_time/2`, use `format_times/1` instead\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile.leex] Require `:leex` to be added as a compiler to run the `leex` compiler\r\n  * [mix compile.yecc] Require `:yecc` to be added as a compiler to run the `yecc` compiler",

Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx] Include source code snippets in syntax errors\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Calendar] Add support for epoch time (`%s`) to `Calendar.strftime/2`\r\n  * [Code] `Code.format_string!/2` now converts `'charlists'` into `~c\"charlists\"` by default\r\n  * [Code] Add `:on_undefined_variable` to the compiler options to preserve the warning behaviour which was deprecated back in Elixir v1.4\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.loaded?/1` and `Code.ensure_all_loaded(!)/1`\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.prepend_paths/1`, `Code.append_paths/1`, and `Code.delete_paths/1`\r\n  * [Code] Add `Code.with_diagnostics/2` to return diagnostics when compiling and evaluating code\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Support nested expressions in `Code.Fragment.cursor_context/1`\r\n  * [Code.Fragment] Keep operators and no paren calls in `Code.Fragment.container_cursor_to_quoted/1`\r\n  * [Date] Add `Date.before?/2` and `Date.after?/2`\r\n  * [DateTime] Add `DateTime.before?/2` and `DateTime.after?/2`\r\n  * [DateTime] Support precision in `DateTime.utc_now/2`\r\n  * [File] Support distributed `File.Stream`\r\n  * [Inspect] `Inspect` now renders `'charlists'` as `~c\"charlists\"` by default\r\n  * [Kernel] Break down `case` and `cond` inside `dbg/2`\r\n  * [Kernel] Add `t:nonempty_binary/0` and `t:nonempty_bitstring/0`\r\n  * [Kernel] Treat `@behaviour`s as runtime dependencies\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not add runtime dependencies for alias references in patterns and guards\r\n  * [Kernel] Warn for nested calls without parens inside keywords\r\n  * [Kernel] Support for multi-letter uppercase sigils\r\n  * [Kernel] Introduce mechanism to collect several errors in a module. Previously, as soon as there was a compilation error, compilation would fail. Now the compiler became a bit smarter and will report multiple errors whenever possible as multiple `error: ...` messages, similar to `warning: ...`\r\n  * [Kernel] Raise instead of warning on undefined variables. Previously, an undefined variable would attempt to invoke a function of the same name, which led to confusing error messages, especially to newcomers. To enable the previous behaviour, invoke `Code.compiler_options(on_undefined_variable: :warn)` at the top of your `mix.exs`\r\n  * [Kernel.CLI] Support `--sname undefined`/`--name undefined` so a name is automatically generated\r\n  * [Keyword] Add `Keyword.split_with/2`\r\n  * [Macro] Improve error message when piping into an expression ending in bracket-based access\r\n  * [Macro.Env] Add `Macro.Env.lookup_alias_as/2`\r\n  * [Map] Add `Map.split_with/2`\r\n  * [Map] Add `Map.intersect/2` and `Map.intersect/3`\r\n  * [MapSet] Add `MapSet.split_with/2`\r\n  * [MapSet] Optimize most functions\r\n  * [NaiveDateTime] Add `NaiveDateTime.beginning_of_day/1` and `NaiveDateTime.end_of_day/1`\r\n  * [NaiveDateTime] Add `NaiveDateTime.before?/2` and `NaiveDateTime.after?/2`\r\n  * [NaiveDateTime] Support precision in `NaiveDateTime.utc_now/2`\r\n  * [Module] Mark functions as generated in \"Docs\" chunk\r\n  * [Module] Add `Module.get_last_attribute/3`\r\n  * [OptionParser] Support `:return_separator` option\r\n  * [Process] Add `Process.alias/0,1` and `Process.unalias/1`\r\n  * [Range] Add `Range.split/2`\r\n  * [String] Update Unicode to version 15.0.0\r\n  * [String] Add `:fast_ascii` mode to `String.valid?/2`\r\n  * [Supervisor] Add support for automatic shutdown in `Supervisor`\r\n  * [System] Support `:lines` in `System.cmd/3` to capture output line by line\r\n  * [Task] Remove head of line blocking on `Task.yield_many/2`\r\n  * [Task] Enable selective receive optimizations in Erlang/OTP 26+\r\n  * [Task] Reduce tasks footprint by avoiding unecessary work during spawning\r\n  * [Task.Supervisor] Do not copy args on temporary `Task.Supervisor.start_child/2`\r\n  * [Time] Add `Time.before?/2` and `Time.after?/2`\r\n  * [URI] Add `URI.append_path/2`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Add more color configuration to ExUnit CLI formatter\r\n  * [ExUnit.Callbacks] Accept `{module, function}` tuples in ExUnit `setup` callbacks\r\n  * [ExUnit.Case] Add `ExUnit.Case.get_last_registered_test/1`\r\n  * [ExUnit.Doctest] Add `ExUnit.DocTest.doctest_file/2`\r\n  * [ExUnit.Doctest] Include `doctest_data` in doctest tags\r\n  * [ExUnit.Formatter] When comparing two anonymous functions, defined at the same place but capturing a different environment, we will now also diff the environments\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx] Make pry opt-in on dbg with `--dbg pry`\r\n  * [IEX] Support `IEX_HOME`\r\n  * [IEx.Autocomplete] Only provide aliases when autocompleting `alias`, `import`, and `require`\r\n  * [IEx.Autocomplete] Provide field completion on map and struct updates\r\n  * [IEx.Helpers] Add `runtime_info(:allocators)`\r\n  * [IEx.Info] Implement protocol for `Range`, `DateTime`, and `Regex`\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n\r\n  * [Logger] Add `Logger.add_handlers/1` and `Logger.default_formatter/1`\r\n  * [Logger] Introduce `default_formatter` and `default_handler` configuration for Logger which configures Erlang/OTP logger\r\n  * [Logger] Add `:always_evaluate_messages` configuration to Logger\r\n  * [Logger.Formatter] Implement the Erlang Logger formatter API\r\n  * [Logger.Formatter] Add support for ports in Logger metadata\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix app.start] Allow applications to be started concurrently via the `:start_concurrently` configuration\r\n  * [mix compile] Set `--all-warnings` by default\r\n  * [mix compile] Reduce the amount of filesystem lookups for path dependencies by storing timestamps in manifests\r\n  * [mix compile] Track digests of `@external_resources`\r\n  * [mix compile.app] Write `optional_applications` to `.app` file\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Add `--purge-consolidation-path-if-stale` which will purge the given consolidation path if compilation is required\r\n  * [mix deps.compile] Automatically recompile dependencies if their compile env changes\r\n  * [mix deps.get] Automatically install Hex and Rebar on `mix deps.get`/`mix deps.update`\r\n  * [mix deps.get] Support `--check-locked` which raises if changes to the lockfile are required\r\n  * [mix eval] Allow passing additional arguments\r\n  * [mix format] Support `--no-exit` option\r\n  * [mix format] Allow multiple formatters per file extension and sigil\r\n  * [mix format] Show diffs whenever `--check-formatted` fails\r\n  * [mix format] Allow the formatting root to be configured\r\n  * [mix loadpaths] Cache deps and archive loadpaths in Erlang/OTP 26\r\n  * [mix profile.fprof] Support `--trace-to-file` to improve performance when working with large outputs\r\n  * [mix release] Allow passing additional arguments to the `eval` command\r\n  * [mix xref graph] Support `--output` flag\r\n  * [Mix.Project] Support `def cli` to unify all CLI defaults in a single place\r\n  * [Mix.Project] Add `Mix.Project.deps_tree/1`\r\n\r\n### 2.

        "body": "This release requires Erlang/OTP 24 and later.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.15 is a smaller release with focused improvements\r\non compilation and boot times. This release also completes\r\nour integration process with Erlang/OTP logger, bringing new\r\nfeatures such as log rotation and compaction out of the box.\r\n\r\nYou will also find additional convenience functions in `Code`,\r\n`Map`, `Keyword`, all Calendar modules, and others.\r\n\r\n## Compile and boot-time improvements\r\n\r\nThe last several releases brought improvements to compilation\r\ntime and this version is no different. In particular, Elixir\r\nnow caches and prunes load paths before compilation, ensuring your\r\nproject (and dependencies!) compile faster and in an environment\r\ncloser to production.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell the Erlang VM loads modules from code paths. Each\r\napplication that ships with Erlang and Elixir plus each dependency\r\nbecome an entry in your code path. The larger the code path, the\r\nmore work Erlang has to do in order to find a module.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, Mix would only add entries to the load paths.\r\nTherefore, if you compiled 20 dependencies and you went to compile\r\nthe 21st, the code path would have 21 entries (plus all Erlang and\r\nElixir apps). This allowed modules from unrelated dependencies to\r\nbe seen and made compilation slower the more dependencies you had.\r\nWith this release, we will now prune the code paths to only the ones\r\nlisted as dependencies, bringing the behaviour closer to `mix release`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Erlang/OTP 26 allows us to start applications\r\nconcurrently and cache the code path lookups, decreasing the cost of\r\nbooting applications. The combination of Elixir v1.15 and Erlang/OTP 26\r\nshould reduce the boot time of applications, such as when starting\r\n`iex -S mix` or running a single test with `mix test`, from 5% to 30%.\r\n\r\nThe compiler is also smarter in several ways: `@behaviour` declarations\r\nno longer add compile-time dependencies and aliases in patterns and\r\nguards add no dependency whatsoever, as no dispatching happens. Furthermore,\r\nMix now tracks the digests of `@external_resource` files, reducing the\r\namount of recompilation when swapping branches. Finally, dependencies\r\nare automatically recompiled when their compile-time configuration changes.\r\n\r\n### Potential incompatibilities\r\n\r\nDue to the code path pruning, if you have an application or dependency\r\nthat does not specify its dependencies on Erlang and Elixir application,\r\nit may no longer compile successfully in Elixir v1.15. You can temporarily\r\ndisable code path pruning by setting `prune_code_paths: false` in your\r\n`mix.exs`, although doing so may lead to runtime bugs that are only\r\nmanifested inside a `mix release`.\r\n\r\n## Compiler warnings and errors\r\n\r\nThe Elixir compiler can now emit many errors for a single file, making\r\nsure more feedback is reported to developers before compilation is aborted.\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.14, an undefined function would be reported as:\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n        my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.15, the new reports will look like:\r\n\r\n    error: undefined function foo/0 (there is no such import)\r\n      my_file.exs:1\r\n\r\n    ** (CompileError) nofile: cannot compile file (errors have been logged)\r\n\r\nA new function, called `Code.with_diagnostics/2`, has been added so this\r\ninformation can be leveraged by editors, allowing them to point to several\r\nerrors at once.\r\n\r\n## Integration with Erlang/OTP logger\r\n\r\nThis release provides additional features such as global logger\r\nmetadata and file logging (with rotation and compaction) out-of-the-box!\r\n\r\nThis release also soft-deprecates Elixir's Logger Backends in\r\nfavor of Erlang's Logger handlers. Elixir will automatically\r\nconvert your `:console` backend configuration into the new\r\nconfiguration. Previously, you would set:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :console,\r\n  level: :error,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is now translated to the equivalent:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger, :default_handler,\r\n  level: :error\r\n\r\nconfig :logger, :default_formatter,\r\n  format: \"$time $message $metadata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use `Logger.Backends.Console` or other backends, they are\r\nstill fully supported and functional. If you implement your own\r\nbackends, you want to consider migrating to\r\n[`:logger_backends`](https://github.com/elixir-lang/logger_backends)\r\nin the long term.\r\n\r\nSee the new `Logger` documentation for more information on the\r\nnew features and on compatibility.\r\n\r\n## v1.15.0-rc.0 (2022-05-22)\r\n\r\n### 1.

        "body": "Elixir v1.14 brings many improvements to the debugging experience in Elixir\r\nand data-type inspection. It also includes a new abstraction for easy\r\npartitioning of processes called `PartitionSupervisor`, as well as improved\r\ncompilation times and error messages.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.14 is the last version to support Erlang/OTP 23. Consider updating\r\nto Erlang/OTP 24 or Erlang/OTP 25.\r\n\r\n## `dbg`\r\n\r\n`Kernel.dbg/2` is a new macro that's somewhat similar to `IO.inspect/2`, but\r\nspecifically tailored for **debugging**.\r\n\r\nWhen called, it prints the value of whatever you pass to it, plus the debugged\r\ncode itself as well as its location. This code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# In my_file.exs\r\nfeature = %{name: :dbg, inspiration: \"Rust\"}\r\ndbg(feature)\r\ndbg(Map.put(feature, :in_version, \"1.14.0\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ elixir my_file.exs\r\n[my_file.exs:2: (file)]\r\nfeature #=> %{inspiration: \"Rust\", name: :dbg}\r\n\r\n[my_file.exs:3: (file)]\r\nMap.put(feature, :in_version, \"1.14.0\") #=> %{in_version: \"1.14.0\", inspiration: \"Rust\", name: :dbg}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`dbg/2` can do more. It's a macro, so it *understands Elixir code*. You can see\r\nthat when you pass a series of `|>` pipes to it. `dbg/2` will print the value\r\nfor every step of the pipeline. This code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# In dbg_pipes.exs\r\n__ENV__.file\r\n|> String.split(\"/\", trim: true)\r\n|> List.last()\r\n|> File.exists?()\r\n|> dbg()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrints this:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ elixir dbg_pipes.exs\r\n[dbg_pipes.exs:5: (file)]\r\n__ENV__.file #=> \"/home/myuser/dbg_pipes.exs\"\r\n|> String.split(\"/\", trim: true) #=> [\"home\", \"myuser\", \"dbg_pipes.exs\"]\r\n|> List.last() #=> \"dbg_pipes.exs\"\r\n|> File.exists?() #=> true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### IEx and Prying\r\n\r\n`dbg/2` supports configurable backends. IEx automatically replaces the default\r\nbackend by one that halts the code execution with `IEx.Pry`, giving developers\r\nthe option to access local variables, imports, and more. This also works with\r\npipelines: if you pass a series of `|>` pipe calls to `dbg` (or pipe into it at the\r\nend, like `|> dbg()`), you'll be able to step through every line in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nYou can keep the default behaviour by passing the `--no-pry` option to IEx.\r\n\r\n## PartitionSupervisor\r\n\r\n`PartitionSupervisor` is a new module that implements a new supervisor type. The\r\npartition supervisor is designed to help with situations where you have a single\r\nsupervised process that becomes a bottleneck. If that process's state can be\r\neasily partitioned, then you can use `PartitionSupervisor` to supervise multiple\r\nisolated copies of that process running concurrently, each assigned its own\r\npartition.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine you have an `ErrorReporter` process that you use to report\r\nerrors to a monitoring service.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# Application supervisor:\r\nchildren = [\r\n  # ...,\r\n  ErrorReporter\r\n]\r\n\r\nSupervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the concurrency of your application goes up, the `ErrorReporter` process\r\nmight receive requests from many other processes and eventually become a\r\nbottleneck. In a case like this, it could help to spin up multiple copies of the\r\n`ErrorReporter` process under a `PartitionSupervisor`.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# Application supervisor\r\nchildren = [\r\n  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: ErrorReporter, name: Reporters}\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `PartitionSupervisor` will spin up a number of processes equal to\r\n`System.schedulers_online()` by default (most often one per core). Now, when\r\nrouting requests to `ErrorReporter` processes we can use a `:via` tuple and\r\nroute the requests through the partition supervisor.\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\npartitioning_key = self()\r\nErrorReporter.report({:via, PartitionSupervisor, {Reporters, partitioning_key}}, error)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `self()` as the partitioning key here means that the same process will\r\nalways report errors to the same `ErrorReporter` process, ensuring a form of\r\nback-pressure. You can use any term as the partitioning key.\r\n\r\n### A Common Example\r\n\r\nA common and practical example of a good use case for `PartitionSupervisor` is\r\npartitioning something like a `DynamicSupervisor`. When starting many processes\r\nunder it, a dynamic supervisor can be a bottleneck, especially if said processes\r\ntake a long time to initialize. Instead of starting a single `DynamicSupervisor`,\r\nyou can start multiple:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nchildren = [\r\n  {PartitionSupervisor, child_spec: DynamicSupervisor, name: MyApp.DynamicSupervisors}\r\n]\r\n\r\nSupervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you start processes on the dynamic supervisor for the right partition.\r\nFor instance, you can partition by PID, like in the previous example:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nDynamicSupervisor.start_child(\r\n  {:via, PartitionSupervisor, {MyApp.DynamicSupervisors, self()}},\r\n  my_child_specification\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Improved errors on binaries and evaluation\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 25 improved errors on binary construction and evaluation. These improvements\r\napply to Elixir as well. Before v1.14, errors when constructing binaries would\r\noften be hard-to-debug generic \"argument errors\". With Erlang/OTP 25 and Elixir v1.14,\r\nmore detail is provided for easier debugging. This work is part of [EEP\r\n54](https://www.erlang.org/eeps/eep-0054).\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nint = 1\r\nbin = \"foo\"\r\nint <> bin\r\n#=> ** (ArgumentError) argument error\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nint = 1\r\nbin = \"foo\"\r\nint <> bin\r\n#=> ** (ArgumentError) construction of binary failed:\r\n#=>    segment 1 of type 'binary':\r\n#=>    expected a binary but got: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Slicing with steps\r\n\r\nElixir v1.12 introduced **stepped ranges**, which are ranges where you can\r\nspecify the \"step\":\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nEnum.to_list(1..10//3)\r\n#=> [1, 4, 7, 10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nStepped ranges are particularly useful for numerical operations involving\r\nvectors and matrices (see [Nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx), for example).\r\nHowever, the Elixir standard library was not making use of stepped ranges in its\r\nAPIs. Elixir v1.14 starts to take advantage of steps with support for stepped\r\nranges in a couple of functions. One of them is `Enum.slice/2`:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nletters = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\"]\r\nEnum.slice(letters, 0..5//2)\r\n#=> [\"a\", \"c\", \"e\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`binary_slice/2` (and `binary_slice/3` for completeness) has been added to the\r\n`Kernel` module, that works with bytes and also support stepped ranges:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nbinary_slice(\"Elixir\", 1..5//2)\r\n#=> \"lxr\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expression-based inspection and `Inspect` improvements\r\n\r\nIn Elixir, it's conventional to implement the `Inspect` protocol for opaque\r\nstructs so that they're inspected with a special notation, resembling this:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nMapSet.new([:apple, :banana])\r\n#MapSet<[:apple, :banana]>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is generally done when the struct content or part of it is private and the\r\n`%name{...}` representation would reveal fields that are not part of the public\r\nAPI.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the `#name<...>` convention is that *the inspected output is not\r\nvalid Elixir code*. For example, you cannot copy the inspected output and paste\r\nit into an IEx session.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.14 changes the convention for some of the standard-library structs.\r\nThe `Inspect` implementation for those structs now returns a string with a valid\r\nElixir expression that recreates the struct when evaluated. In the `MapSet`\r\nexample above, this is what we have now:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nfruits = MapSet.new([:apple, :banana])\r\nMapSet.put(fruits, :pear)\r\n#=> MapSet.new([:apple, :banana, :pear])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `MapSet.new/1` expression evaluates to exactly the struct that we're\r\ninspecting. This allows us to hide the internals of `MapSet`, while keeping\r\nit as valid Elixir code. This expression-based inspection has been\r\nimplemented for `Version.Requirement`, `MapSet`, and `Date.Range`.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have improved the `Inspect` protocol for structs so that\r\nfields are inspected in the order they are declared in `defstruct`.\r\nThe option `:optional` has also been added when deriving the `Inspect`\r\nprotocol, giving developers more control over the struct representation.\r\nSee the updated documentation for `Inspect` for a general rundown on\r\nthe approaches and options available.\r\n\r\n### 1.

Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [elixirc] Change the output of `--profile time` to make it easier to detect outliers\r\n  * [Application] Do not add compile time deps on args to `Application.compile_env/2` and `Application.compile_env!/2`\r\n  * [Enum] Optimize `Enum.into/3` and `Map.new/2`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile] Compile most recently changed files first\r\n  * [mix compile, mix run, mix test] Speed up the time taken to load dependencies. This should make the usage of Mix inside projects quite more responsive\r\n\r\n### Checksums\r\n\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA1: 051c2728bfd679d1d6f74d11f25ca679491cd6b4\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA512: 38eb2281032b0cb096ef5e61f048c5374d6fb9bf4078ab8f9526a42e16e7c661732a632b55d6072328eedf87a47e6eeb3f0e3f90bba1086239c71350f90c75e5\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA1: a3573b1a759944669dec951b38d3a978e17ba535\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA512: ed1d9814e53a7d8abb13354f1772881640f84cb55dd6f4fdf24465b871aae5561d0b64627b2cba03dd00494c1822ce1108956b02cdaa230d41ce7e5c6ede1222",

Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [CLI] Ensure `-e \"\"` (with an empty string) parses correctly on Windows\r\n  * [Inspect] Do not override user supplied `:limit` option for derived implementations\r\n  * [Kernel] Allow heredoc inside a heredoc interpolation\r\n  * [Kernel] Preserve CRLF on heredocs\r\n  * [Kernel] Public functions without documentation now appear as an empty map on `Code.fetch_docs/1`, unless they start with underscore, where they remain as `:none`. This aligns Elixir's implementation with EEP48\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not crash when complex literals (binaries and maps) are used in guards\r\n  * [Kernel] Properly parse keywords (such as `end`) followed by the `::` operator\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not ignore unimplemented signatures from generated functions\r\n  * [Kernel] Improve error message when an expression follows a keyword list without brackets\r\n  * [Macro] `Macro.decompose_call/1` now also consider tuples with more than 2 elements to not be valid calls\r\n  * [Macro] Fix `Macro.to_string/1` double-escaping of escape characters in sigils\r\n  * [Macro] Fix `Macro.underscore/1` on digits preceded by capitals: \"FOO10\" now becomes \"foo10\" instead of \"fo_o10\"\r\n  * [Macro] Preserve underscores between digits on `Macro.underscore/1`\r\n  * [OptionParser] Properly parse when numbers follow-up aliases, for example, `-ab3` is now parsed as `-a -b 3`\r\n  * [Path] Fix `Path.relative_to/2` when referencing self\r\n  * [Path] Do not crash when a volume is given to `Path.absname/1`, such as \"c:\"\r\n  * [Task] Ensure `Task.async_stream/2` with `ordered: false` discard results as they are emitted, instead of needlessly accumulating inside the stream manager\r\n  * [Task] Raise if `:max_concurrency` is set to 0 on streaming operations\r\n  * [URI] Do not discard empty paths on `URI.merge/2`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Case] Make `@tag tmp_dir` an absolute directory, avoiding inconsistencies if the test changes the current working directory\r\n  * [ExUnit.Diff] Fix cases where the diffing algorithm would fail to print a pattern correct\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx] Fix auto-completion inside remote shells\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix app.config] Do not emit false positive warnings when configured dependencies that have `runtime: false` set\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Ensure that a manifest is generated even with no source code\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Make sure export dependencies trigger recompilation when the dependency is removed as well as when the whole file is removed\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Do not emit false positive warnings when a path dependency adds a module that is then used by the current application in the same `mix compile` cycle\r\n  * [mix test] Ensure protocols within the current project are consolidated when `--cover` is given\r\n  * [mix release] Improve compliance of release scripts with stripped down Linux installations\r\n  * [mix release] Preserve file mode when copying non-beam ebin files\r\n  * [mix xref] Ensure args are passed to the underlying `mix compile` call\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft-deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Kernel] Using `first..last` to match on ranges is soft-deprecated and will warn on future Elixir versions. Use `first..last//step` instead\r\n  * [Kernel] Using `first..last` to create decreasing ranges is soft-deprecated and will warn on future versions. Use `first..last//-1` instead\r\n\r\n### 4. Hard-deprecations\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n\r\n  * [EEx.Engine] `use EEx.Engine` is deprecated in favor of explicit delegation\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Kernel] The binary operator `^^^` is deprecated. If you are using `Bitwise.^^^/2`, use `Bitwise.bxor/2` instead\r\n  * [Kernel] Deprecate `@foo()` in favor of `@foo`\r\n  * [System] Deprecate `System.stacktrace/0` (it was already deprecated outside of catch/rescue and now it is deprecated everywhere)\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile] The `:xref` compiler is deprecated and it has no effect. Please remove it from your mix.exs file.\r\n\r\n### Checksums\r\n\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA1: b607b2d0e78e1ae6f9d112ba3e1b617a1ee7580b\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA512: 57e970640f7e273a62fbde60545ed85c18d667e194d0d3483b941ea3164f12664cc0c186968c1f341253f1907157ae88953b5caa413204f93bba08710fdc0b50\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA1: fbf8939ea56f3cdda90ee04680fdc43f7b1d41e2\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA512: c06ee0a72cbb4cc138a11b1acee14efde2cc2c7de5a121ee386c9a9ba583ccc10dd8b5ebc29cbf89bd9da8c091868d8fdd4b148bfa6fa564dc033449700d0b08\r\n",

        "body": "Over the last releases, the Elixir team has been focusing on the compiler, both in terms of catching more mistakes at compilation time and making it faster. Elixir v1.11 has made excellent progress on both fronts. This release also includes many other goodies, such as tighter Erlang integration, support for more guard expressions, built-in datetime formatting, and other calendar enhancements.\r\n\r\n## Tighter Erlang integration\r\n\r\nFollowing Elixir v1.10, we have further integrated with Erlang's new logger by adding four new log levels: `notice`, `critical`, `alert`, and `emergency`, matching all log levels found in the Syslog standard. The `Logger` module now supports structured logging by passing maps and keyword lists to its various functions. It is also possible to specify the log level per module, via the `Logger.put_module_level/2` function. Log levels per application will be added in future releases.\r\n\r\nIEx also has been improved to show the documentation for Erlang modules directly from your Elixir terminal. This works with Erlang/OTP 23+ and requires Erlang modules to have been compiled with documentation chunks.\r\n\r\n## Compiler checks: application boundaries\r\n\r\nElixir v1.11 builds on top of the recently added compilation tracers to track application boundaries. From this release, Elixir will warn if you invoke a function from an existing module but this module does not belong to any of your listed dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese two conditions may seem contradictory. After all, if a module is available, it must have come from a dependency. This is not true in two scenarios:\r\n\r\n  * Modules from Elixir and Erlang/OTP are always available - even if their applications are not explicitly listed as a dependency\r\n\r\n  * In an umbrella project, because all child applications are compiled within the same VM, you may have a module from a sibling project available, even if you don't depend on said sibling\r\n\r\nThis new compiler check makes sure that all modules that you invoke are listed as part of your dependencies, emitting a warning like below otherwise:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n:ssl.connect/2 defined in application :ssl is used by the current\r\napplication but the current application does not directly depend\r\non :ssl. To fix this, you must do one of:\r\n\r\n  1. If :ssl is part of Erlang/Elixir, you must include it under\r\n     :extra_applications inside \"def application\" in your mix.exs\r\n\r\n  2. If :ssl is a dependency, make sure it is listed under \"def deps\"\r\n     in your mix.exs\r\n\r\n  3. In case you don't want to add a requirement to :ssl, you may\r\n     optionally skip this warning by adding [xref: [exclude: :ssl]\r\n     to your \"def project\" in mix.exs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes with extra benefits in umbrella projects, as it requires child applications to explicitly list their dependencies, completely rejecting cyclic dependencies between siblings.\r\n\r\n## Compiler checks: data constructors\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.11, the compiler also tracks structs and maps fields across a function body. For example, imagine you wanted to write this code:\r\n\r\n    def drive?(%User{age: age}), do: age >= 18\r\n\r\nIf there is either a typo on the `:age` field or the `:age` field was not yet defined, the compiler will fail accordingly. However, if you wrote this code:\r\n\r\n    def drive?(%User{} = user), do: user.age >= 18\r\n\r\nThe compiler would not catch the missing field and an error would only be raised at runtime. With v1.11, Elixir will track the usage of all maps and struct fields within the same function, emitting warnings for cases like above:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nwarning: undefined field `age` in expression:\r\n\r\n    # example.exs:7\r\n    user.age\r\n\r\nexpected one of the following fields: name, address\r\n\r\nwhere \"user\" was given the type %User{} in:\r\n\r\n    # example.exs:7\r\n    %User{} = user\r\n\r\nConflict found at\r\n  example.exs:7: Check.drive?/1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe compiler also checks binary constructors. Consider you have to send a string over the wire with length-based encoding, where the string is prefixed by its length, up to 4MBs. Your initial attempt may be this:\r\n\r\n    def run_length(string) when is_binary(string) do\r\n      <<byte_size(string)::32, string>>\r\n    end\r\n\r\nHowever, the code above has a bug. Each segment given between `<<>>` must be an integer, unless specified otherwise. With Elixir v1.11, the compiler will let you know so:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nwarning: incompatible types:\r\n\r\n    binary() !~ integer()\r\n\r\nin expression:\r\n\r\n    <<byte_size(string)::integer()-size(32), string>>\r\n\r\nwhere \"string\" was given the type integer() in:\r\n\r\n    # foo.exs:4\r\n    <<byte_size(string)::integer()-size(32), string>>\r\n\r\nwhere \"string\" was given the type binary() in:\r\n\r\n    # foo.exs:3\r\n    is_binary(string)\r\n\r\nHINT: all expressions given to binaries are assumed to be of type integer()\r\nunless said otherwise. For example, <<expr>> assumes \"expr\" is an integer.\r\nPass a modifier, such as <<expr::float>> or <<expr::binary>>, to change the\r\ndefault behaviour.\r\n\r\nConflict found at\r\n  foo.exs:4: Check.run_length/1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich can be fixed by adding `::binary` to the second component:\r\n\r\n    def run_length(string) when is_binary(string) do\r\n      <<byte_size(string)::32, string::binary>>\r\n    end\r\n\r\nWhile some of those warnings could be automatically fixed by the compiler, future versions will also perform those checks across functions and potentially across modules, where automatic fixes wouldn't be desired (nor possible).\r\n\r\n## Compilation time improvements\r\n\r\nElixir v1.11 features many improvements to how the compiler tracks file dependencies, such that touching one file causes less files to be recompiled. In previous versions, Elixir tracked three types of dependencies:\r\n\r\n  * compile time dependencies - if A depends on B at compile time, such as by using a macro, whenever B changes, A is recompiled\r\n  * struct dependencies - if A depends on B's struct, whenever B's struct definition changed, A is recompiled\r\n  * runtime dependencies - if A depends on B at runtime, A is never recompiled\r\n\r\nHowever, because dependencies are transitive, if A depends on B at compile time and B depends on C at runtime, A would depend on C at compile time. Therefore, it is very important to reduce the amount of compile time dependencies.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.11 replaces \"struct dependencies\" by \"exports dependencies\". In other words, if A depends on B, whenever B public's interface changes, A is recompiled. B's public interface is made by its struct definition and all of its public functions and macros.\r\n\r\nThis change allows us to mark `import`s and `require`s as \"exports dependencies\" instead of \"compile time\" dependencies. This simplifies the dependency graph considerably. For example, [in the Hex.pm project](https://github.com/hexpm/hexpm), changing the `user.ex` file in Elixir v1.10 would emit this:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ touch lib/hexpm/accounts/user.ex && mix compile\r\nCompiling 90 files (.ex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.11, we now get:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ touch lib/hexpm/accounts/user.ex && mix compile\r\nCompiling 16 files (.ex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make things even better, Elixir v1.11 also introduces a more granular file tracking for path dependencies. In previous versions, a module from a path dependency would always be treated as a compile time dependency. This often meant that if you have an umbrella project, changing an application would cause many modules in sibling applications to recompile. Fortunately, Elixir v1.11 will tag modules from dependencies as exports if appropriate, yielding dramatic improvements to those using path dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo round up the list of compiler enhancements, the `--profile=time` option added in Elixir v1.10 now also includes the time to compile each individual file. For example, in the Plug project, one can now get:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[profile] lib/plug/conn.ex compiled in 935ms\r\n[profile] lib/plug/ssl.ex compiled in 147ms (plus 744ms waiting)\r\n[profile] lib/plug/static.ex compiled in 238ms (plus 654ms waiting)\r\n[profile] lib/plug/csrf_protection.ex compiled in 237ms (plus 790ms waiting)\r\n[profile] lib/plug/debugger.ex compiled in 719ms (plus 947ms waiting)\r\n[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 60 modules in 1802ms\r\n[profile] Finished group pass check of 60 modules in 75ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile implementing those features, we have also made the `--long-compilation-threshold` flag more precise. In previous versions, `--long-compilation-threshold` would consider both the time a file spent to compile and the time spent waiting on other files. In Elixir v1.11, it considers only the compilation time. This means less false positives and you can now effectively get all files that take longer than 2s to compile by passing `--long-compilation-threshold 2`.\r\n\r\n## `mix xref graph` improvements\r\n\r\nTo bring visibility to the compiler tracking improvements described in the previous section, we have also added new features to `mix xref`. `mix xref` is a task that describes cross-references between files in your projects. The `mix xref graph` subsection focuses on the dependency graph between them.\r\n\r\nFirst we have made the existing `--label` flag to consider transitive dependencies. Using `--sink FILE` and `--label compile` can be a powerful combo to find out which files will change whenever the given `FILE` changes. For example, in the Hex.pm project, we get:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n$ mix xref graph --sink lib/hexpm/accounts/user.ex --label compile\r\nlib/hexpm/billing/hexpm.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm/billing/billing.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm/billing/local.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm/billing/billing.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm/emails/bamboo.ex\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm/accounts/email.ex (compile)\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm/accounts/user.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm/emails/emails.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/views/email_view.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/docs_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/key_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/organization_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/organization_user_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/owner_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/package_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/release_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/repository_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/api/retirement_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/controllers/auth_helpers.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/controllers/blog_controller.ex\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/views/blog_view.ex (compile)\r\nlib/hexpm_web/endpoint.ex\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/plug_parser.ex (compile)\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 lib/hexpm_web/session.ex (compile)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the files at the root will recompile if `lib/hexpm/accounts/user.ex` changes. Their children describe the *why*. For example, the `repository_controller.ex` file will recompile if user changes because it has a compile time dependency on `auth_helpers.ex`, which depends on `user.ex`. This indirect compile time dependency is often the source of recompilations and Elixir v1.11 now makes it trivial to spot them, so they can be eventually addressed.\r\n\r\nAnother improvement to `mix xref graph` is the addition of `--format cycles`, which will print all cycles in your compilation dependency graph. A `--min-cycle-size` flag can be used if you want to discard short cycles.\r\n\r\n## `config/runtime.exs` and `mix app.config`\r\n\r\nElixir v1.9 introduced a new configuration file, specific to releases, called `config/releases.exs`. A release is a self-contained artifact with the Erlang VM, Elixir and your application, ready to run in production.\r\n\r\nThe addition of `config/releases.exs` has been a very useful one but, unfortunately, it applies only to releases. Developers not using releases must use the `config/config.exs` file, which often loaded too early at compilation time. For any dynamic configuration, developers had to resort to third-party tools or workarounds to achieve the desired results.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.11 addresses this issue by introducing a new configuration file, called `config/runtime.exs`. This new configuration file is loaded exactly before your application starts, when the code is already fully compiled. It is loaded in development, test, and production, regardless if you are using Mix or releases. Therefore it provides a unified API for runtime configuration in Elixir.\r\n\r\n`config/runtime.exs` works the same as any other configuration file. However, given `config/runtime.exs` is meant to run with or without Mix, developers must not use `Mix.env()` or `Mix.target()` in `config/runtime.exs`. Instead, they must use the new `config_env()` and `config_target()`, which have been added to the `Config` module.\r\n\r\nWhile `config/releases.exs` will continue to be supported, developers can migrate to `config/runtime.exs` without loss of functionality. For example, a `config/releases.exs` file such as this one\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# config/releases.exs\r\nimport Config\r\n\r\nconfig :foo, ...\r\nconfig :bar, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\ncould run as is as `config/runtime.exs`. However, given `config/runtime.exs` runs in all environments, you may want to restrict part of your configuration to the `:prod` environment:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# config/runtime.exs\r\nimport Config\r\n\r\nif config_env() == :prod do\r\n  config :foo, ...\r\n  config :bar, ...\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf both files are available, releases will pick the now preferred `config/runtime.exs` instead of `config/releases.exs`.\r\n\r\nTo wrap it all up, `Mix` also includes a new task called `mix app.config`. This task loads all applications and configures them, without starting them. Whenever you write your own Mix tasks, you will typically want to invoke either `mix app.start` or `mix app.config` before running your own code. Which one is better depends if you want your applications running or only configured.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\nElixir v1.11 adds the `is_struct/2`, `is_exception/1`, and `is_exception/2` guards. It also adds support for the `map.field` syntax in guards.\r\n\r\nThe Calendar module ships with a new `Calendar.strftime/3` function, which provides datetime formatting based on the `strftime` format. The `Date` module got new functions for working with weeks and months, such as `Date.beginning_of_month/1` and `Date.end_of_week/2`. Finally, all calendar types got conversion functions from and to gregorian timestamps, such as `Date.from_gregorian_days/2` and `NaiveDateTime.to_gregorian_seconds/1`.\r\n\r\nMix also includes two new tasks: `mix app.config`, for application runtime configuration, and `mix test.coverage`, which generates aggregated coverage reports for umbrella projects and for test suites partitioned across processes.\r\n\r\n## v1.11.0 (2020-10-06)\r\n\r\n### 1.

        "body": "## Support for Erlang/OTP 21+\r\n\r\nElixir v1.10 requires Erlang/OTP 21+, allowing Elixir to integrate with Erlang/OTP's new logger. Currently, this means that the logger level, logger metadata, as well as all log messages are now shared between Erlang and Elixir APIs.\r\n\r\nWe will continue improving the relationship between the logging systems in future releases. In particular, we plan to expose all log levels and runtime filtering functionalities available in Erlang directly into Elixir in the next Elixir version.\r\n\r\nThis release also adds two new guards, `is_struct/1` and `is_map_key/2`, thanks to the strict requirement on Erlang/OTP 21+.\r\n\r\n## Releases improvements\r\n\r\nElixir v1.9 introduced releases as a mechanism to package self-contained applications. Elixir v1.10 further improves releases with bug fixes and new enhancements based on feedback we got from the community. The highlights are:\r\n\r\n  * Allow the dual boot system of releases to be disabled on environments that are boot-time sensitive, such as embedded devices\r\n\r\n  * Track and raise if compile-time configuration is set or changes at runtime (more in the next section)\r\n\r\n  * Support for easily adding extra files to releases via overlays\r\n\r\n  * Allow `RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION` to be set to `none` in order to fully disable it\r\n\r\n  * Add a built-in `:tar` step that automatically packages releases\r\n\r\nSee the full CHANGELOG for more improvements.\r\n\r\n## Improvements to sort-based APIs in Enum\r\n\r\n`Enum.sort/1` in Elixir by default sorts from lowest to highest:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"])\r\n[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to sort from highest to lowest, you need to call `Enum.sort/2` with a custom sorting function, such as `Enum.sort(collection, &>=/2)`, which is not immediately obvious to someone reading the code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"], &>=/2)\r\n[\"pineapple\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, comparison operators, such as `<=` and `>=`, perform structural sorting, instead of a semantic one. For example, using `>=` to sort dates descendingly won't yield the correct result:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]])\r\n[~D[2020-01-01], ~D[2019-12-31]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo perform proper semantic comparison for dates, one would also need to pass a custom sorting function:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]], &(Date.compare(&1, &2) != :lt))\r\n[~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nElixir v1.10 streamlines the sorting functions by introducing both `:asc` and `:desc` shortcuts:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"], :asc)\r\n[\"apple\", \"banana\", \"pineapple\"]\r\niex> Enum.sort([\"banana\", \"apple\", \"pineapple\"], :desc)\r\n[\"pineapple\", \"banana\", \"apple\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs well as adding the possibility to pass a module to perform semantic comparisons. For example, to sort dates, one now only needs to pass the `Date` module or even `{:desc, Date}` for descending semantical sort:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\niex> Enum.sort([~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]], Date)\r\n[~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]]\r\niex> Enum.sort([~D[2019-12-31], ~D[2020-01-01]], {:desc, Date})\r\n[~D[2020-01-01], ~D[2019-12-31]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese API improvements make the code more concise and readable and they have also been added to `Enum.sort_by`, `Enum.min_by`, `Enum.max_by`, and friends.\r\n\r\n## Tracking of compile-time configuration\r\n\r\nIn Elixir, we organize our code in applications. Libraries, your dependencies, and your own project are all separate applications. All applications in Elixir also come with an application environment.\r\n\r\nThe application environment is a key-value store that allows us to configure said application. While reading the application environment at runtime is the preferred approach, in some rare occasions you may want to use the application environment to configure the compilation of a certain project. This is often done by calling `Application.get_env/3` outside of a function:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule MyApp.DBClient do\r\n  @db_host Application.get_env(:my_app, :db_host, \"db.local\")\r\n  def start_link() do\r\n    SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: @db_host)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach has one big limitation: if you change the value of the application environment after the code is compiled, the value used at runtime is not going to change! For example, if you are using `mix release` and your `config/releases.exs` has:\r\n\r\n    config :my_app, :db_host, \"db.production\"\r\n\r\nBecause `config/releases.exs` is read after the code is compiled, the new value will have no effect as the code was compiled to connect to \"db.local\".\r\n\r\nOf course, the obvious solution to this mismatch is to not read the application environment at compilation time in the first place, and instead move the code to inside a function:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule MyApp.DBClient do\r\n  def start_link() do\r\n    SomeLib.DBClient.start_link(host: db_host())\r\n  end\r\n  defp db_host() do\r\n    Application.get_env(:my_app, :db_host, \"db.local\")\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is the preferred approach, there are still two scenarios we need to address:\r\n\r\n  1. Not everyone may be aware of this pitfall, so they will mistakenly read the application environemnt at compile-time, until they are bitten by this behaviour\r\n\r\n  2. In rare occasions, you trully need to read the application environment at compile-time, and you want to be warned when you try to configure at runtime something that is valid only at compilation time\r\n\r\nElixir v1.10 aims to solve these two scenarios by introducing a `Application.compile_env/3` function. For example, to read the value at compile time, you can now do:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n@db_host Application.compile_env(:my_app, :db_host, \"db.local\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy using `compile_env/3`, Elixir will store the values used during compilation and compare them with the runtime values whenever your system starts, raising an error in case they differ. This helps developers ensure they are running their production systems with the configuration they intend to.\r\n\r\nIn future versions, we will deprecate the use `Application.get_env` at compile-time with a clear message pointing users to configuration best practices, effectively addressing the scenario where users read from the application environment at compile time unaware of its pitfalls.\r\n\r\n## Compiler tracing\r\n\r\nThis release brings enhancements to the Elixir compiler and adds new capabilities for developers to listen to compilation events.\r\n\r\nIn previous Elixir versions, Elixir would compile a database of cross references between modules (such as function calls, references, structs, etc) for each project in order to perform all kinds of checks, such as deprecations and undefined functions.\r\n\r\nAlthough this database was not public, developers would still use it to run their own checks against their projects. With time, developers would request more data to be included in the database, which was problematic as Elixir itself did not have a use for the additional data, and the database was not meant to be used externally in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.10, we have addressed these problems by introducing compiler tracing. The compiler tracing allows developers to listen to events as they are emitted by the compiler, so they can store all of the information they need - and only the information they need.\r\n\r\nElixir itself is using the new compiler tracing to provide new functionality. One advantage of this approach is that developers can now disable undefined function warnings directly on the callsite. For example, imagine you have an optional dependency which may not be available in some cases. You can tell the compiler to skip warning on calls to optional modules with:\r\n\r\n    @compile {:no_warn_undefined, OptionalDependency}\r\n    defdelegate my_function_call(arg), to: OptionalDependency\r\n\r\nPreviously, this information had to be added to the overall project configuration, which was far away from where the optional call effectively happened.\r\n\r\n## Other enhancements\r\n\r\nElixir's calendar data types got many improvements, such as sigil support for third-party calendars, as well as the additions of `DateTime.now!/2`, `DateTime.shift_zone!/3`, and `NaiveDateTime.local_now/0`.\r\n\r\nThere are many improvements related to Elixir's AST in this release too. First of all, `Code.string_to_quoted/2` has two new options, `:token_metadata` and `:literal_encoder`, that give more control over Elixir's parser. This information was already available to the Elixir code formatter and has now been made public. We have also extensively documented all of Elixir's AST metadata. These changes alongside compiler tracing means static analyzers and IDE integrations have a better foundation to analyze the source code.\r\n\r\nExUnit, our test framework, ships two small but important improvements: `ExUnit.CaptureIO` can now be used by tests that run concurrently and we have added \"pattern-matching diffing\". To understand the last feature, take this code:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nassert %{\"status\" => 200, \"body\" => %{\"key\" => \"foo\"}} = json_payload\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow imagine that `json_payload` is a large JSON blob and the `\"key\"` inside the `\"body\"` did not have value of `\"foo\"`. In previous Elixir versions, if the assertion failed, Elixir would print the right side and let you up to your own devices to figure out what went wrong. In Elixir v1.10, we diff the data structure against the pattern so you can see exactly which parts of the data matched the pattern and which ones did not. Note ExUnit already performed diffing when comparing data types, this new version adds diffing when matching data agaainst a pattern.\r\n\r\n## CHANGELOG\r\n\r\n### 1.

Support for passing URLs to said commands will be fully removed on Elixir v1.10, as they are unsafe. Thanks to Bram Verburg for the report and for providing a fix.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is straight-forward: you can simply download the artifact via the command line and then invoke the command with a file system path. For example, instead of:\r\n\r\n    $ mix archive.install https://example.org/installer.ez\r\n\r\nYou can execute on Unix (Linux, MacOS X):\r\n\r\n    $ wget https://example.org/installer.ez\r\n    $ mix archive.install installer.ez\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    $ curl -o installer.ez https://example.org/installer.ez\r\n    $ mix archive.install installer.ez\r\n\r\nOn Windows (Win7 or later):\r\n\r\n    > powershell -Command \"Invoke-WebRequest https://example.org/installer.ez -OutFile installer.ez\"\r\n    > mix archive.install installer.ez\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    > powershell -Command \"(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://example.org/installer.ez', 'installer.ez')\"\r\n    > mix archive.install installer.ez\r\n\r\nNote that, if you are a library author, consider providing installable escripts and archives through Hex, such as Phoenix:\r\n\r\n    $ mix archive.install hex phx_new\r\n\r\nInstallations through Hex are always safe and they come with version management and all other benefits from Hex too.\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix release] Add :tar option for releases to create a tarball\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix release] Use `default_release` option when name is not given\r\n  * [mix release] Make release's boot script contents deterministic\r\n\r\n### 3. Deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix archive.install] Warn when installing from URI\r\n  * [mix escript.install] Warn when installing from URI\r\n  * [mix local.rebar] Warn when installing from URI\r\n\r\n### Checksums\r\n\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA1: 8bcf1cca9a946db02af570a78b007e9424cd933f\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA512: e5252721b5a08f48c5988027cb765f9317e7e271e52f3f4a3ebcb77581eb584c9aa0cdb216e12a3d626f725964fde2af84ce2241ac8b04d034dd461206c17f54\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA1: a7935d18ec5a04dd7a3e631483e31b6fbe6a8b1d\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA512: 59a53ed8a83920afaf087ecd6edb39a6401d9c917a113ce0ea7ad05612a33f35f188e3673e50c7b068b614c6121461095b32a4385d9a838e8b6461274a9ac6d6\r\n"

        "body": "## Releases\r\n\r\nThe main feature in Elixir v1.9 is the addition of releases. A release is a self-contained directory that consists of your application code, all of its dependencies, plus the whole Erlang Virtual Machine (VM) and runtime. Once a release is assembled, it can be packaged and deployed to a target as long as the target runs on the same operating system (OS) distribution and version as the machine running the `mix release` command.\r\n\r\nYou can start a new project and assemble a release for it in three easy steps:\r\n\r\n    $ mix new my_app\r\n    $ cd my_app\r\n    $ MIX_ENV=prod mix release\r\n\r\nA release will be assembled in `_build/prod/rel/my_app`. Inside the release, there will be a `bin/my_app` file which is the entry point to your system. It supports multiple commands, such as:\r\n\r\n  * `bin/my_app start`, `bin/my_app start_iex`, `bin/my_app restart`, and `bin/my_app stop` - for general management of the release\r\n\r\n  * `bin/my_app rpc COMMAND` and `bin/my_app remote` - for running commands on the running system or to connect to the running system\r\n\r\n  * `bin/my_app eval COMMAND` - to start a fresh system that runs a single command and then shuts down\r\n\r\n  * `bin/my_app daemon` and `bin/my_app daemon_iex` - to start the system as a daemon on Unix-like systems\r\n\r\n  * `bin/my_app install` - to install the system as a service on Windows machines\r\n\r\n### Why releases?\r\n\r\nReleases allow developers to precompile and package all of their code and the runtime into a single unit. The benefits of releases are:\r\n\r\n  * Code preloading. The VM has two mechanisms for loading code: interactive and embedded. By default, it runs in the interactive mode which dynamically loads modules when they are used for the first time. The first time your application calls `Enum.map/2`, the VM will find the `Enum` module and load it. There\u2019s a downside. When you start a new server in production, it may need to load many other modules, causing the first requests to have an unusual spike in response time. Releases run in embedded mode, which loads all available modules upfront, guaranteeing your system is ready to handle requests after booting.\r\n\r\n  * Configuration and customization. Releases give developers fine grained control over system configuration and the VM flags used to start the system.\r\n\r\n  * Self-contained. A release does not require the source code to be included in your production artifacts. All of the code is precompiled and packaged. Releases do not even require Erlang or Elixir in your servers, as they include the Erlang VM and its runtime by default. Furthermore, both Erlang and Elixir standard libraries are stripped to bring only the parts you are actually using.\r\n\r\n  * Multiple releases. You can assemble different releases with different configuration per application or even with different applications altogether.\r\n\r\n### Hooks and Configuration\r\n\r\nReleases also provide built-in hooks for configuring almost every need of the production system:\r\n\r\n  * `config/config.exs` (and `config/prod.exs`) - provides build-time application configuration, which is executed when the release is assembled\r\n\r\n  * `config/releases.exs` - provides runtime application configuration. It is executed every time the release boots and is further extensible via config providers\r\n\r\n  * `rel/vm.args.eex` - a template file that is copied into every release and provides static configuration of the Erlang Virtual Machine and other runtime flags\r\n\r\n  * `rel/env.sh.eex` and `rel/env.bat.eex` - template files that are copied into every release and executed on every command to set up environment variables, including ones specific to the VM, and the general environment\r\n\r\nWe have written extensive documentation on releases, so we recommend checking it out for more information.\r\n\r\n## Configuration overhaul\r\n\r\nA new `Config` module has been added to Elixir. The previous configuration API, `Mix.Config`, was part of the Mix build tool. But since releases provide runtime configuration and Mix is not included in releases, we ported the `Mix.Config` API to Elixir. In other words, `use Mix.Config` has been soft-deprecated in favor of `import Config`.\r\n\r\nAnother important change related to configuration is that `mix new` will no longer generate a `config/config.exs` file. [Relying on configuration is undesired for most libraries](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/library-guidelines.html#avoid-application-configuration) and the generated config files pushed library authors in the wrong direction. Furthermore, `mix new --umbrella` will no longer generate a configuration for each child app, instead all configuration should be declared in the umbrella root. That's how it has always behaved, we are now making it explicit.\r\n\r\n## Other enhancements\r\n\r\nThere are many other enhancements. The Elixir CLI got a handful of new options in order to best support releases. `Logger` now computes its sync/async/discard thresholds in a decentralized fashion, reducing contention. `EEx` templates support more complex expressions than before. Finally, there is a new `~U` sigil for working with UTC DateTimes as well as new functions in the `File`, `Registry`, and `System` modules.\r\n\r\n## v1.9.0 (2019-06-24)\r\n\r\n### 1.

        "body": "Elixir v1.8 comes with many improvements at the infrastructure level, improving compilation time, speeding up common patterns, and adding features around introspection of the system.\r\n\r\n## Custom struct inspections\r\n\r\nElixir now provides a derivable implementation of the `Inspect` protocol. In a nutshell, this means it is really easy to filter data from your data structures whenever they are inspected. For example, imagine you have a user struct with security and privacy sensitive information:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule User do\r\n  defstruct [:id, :name, :age, :email, :encrypted_password]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy default, if you inspect a user via `inspect(user)`, it will include all fields. This can cause fields such as `:email` and `:encrypted_password` to appear in logs, error reports, etc. You could always define a custom implementation of the `Inspect` protocol for such cases but Elixir v1.8 makes it simpler by allowing you to derive the `Inspect` protocol:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndefmodule User do\r\n  @derive {Inspect, only: [:id, :name, :age]}\r\n  defstruct [:id, :name, :age, :email, :encrypted_password]\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow all user structs will be printed with all remaining fields collapsed:\r\n\r\n    #User<id: 1, name: \"Jane\", age: 33, ...>\r\n\r\nYou can also pass `@derive {Inspect, except: [...]}` in case you want to keep all fields by default and exclude only some.\r\n\r\n## Time zone database support\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.3, Elixir added four types, known as Calendar types, to work with dates and times: `Time`, `Date`, `NaiveDateTime` (without time zone) and `DateTime` (with time zone). Over the last releases we have added many enhancements to the Calendar types but the `DateTime` module always evolved at a slower pace since Elixir did not provide support for a time zone database.\r\n\r\nElixir v1.8 now defines a `Calendar.TimeZoneDatabase` behaviour, allowing developers to bring in their own time zone databases. By defining an explicit contract for time zone behaviours, Elixir can now extend the `DateTime` API, adding functions such as `DateTime.shift_zone/3`. By default, Elixir ships with a time zone database called `Calendar.UTCOnlyTimeZoneDatabase` that only handles UTC.\r\n\r\nOther Calendar related improvements include the addition of `Date.day_of_year/1`, `Date.quarter_of_year/1`, `Date.year_of_era/1`, and `Date.day_of_era/1`.\r\n\r\n## Faster compilation and other performance improvements\r\n\r\nDue to improvements to the compiler made over the last year, Elixir v1.8 should compile code about 5% faster on average. This is yet another release where we have been able to reduce compilation times and provide a more joyful development experience to everyone.\r\n\r\nThe compiler also emits more efficient code for range checks in guards (such as `x in y..z`), for charlists with interpolation (such as `'foo #{bar} baz'`), and when working with records via the `Record` module.\r\n\r\nFinally, EEx templates got their own share of optimizations, emitting more compact code that runs faster.\r\n\r\n## Improved instrumentation and ownership with `$callers`\r\n\r\nThe `Task` module is one of the most common ways to spawn light-weight processes to perform work concurrently. Whenever you spawn a new process, Elixir annotates the parent of that process through the `$ancestors` key. This information can be used by instrumentation tools to track the relationship between events occurring within multiple processes. However, many times, tracking only the `$ancestors` is not enough.\r\n\r\nFor example, we recommend developers to always start tasks under a supervisor. This provides more visibility and allows us to control how those tasks are terminated when a node shuts down. In your code, this can be done by invoking something like: `Task.Supervisor.start_child(MySupervisor, task_specification)`. This means that, although your code is the one who invokes the task, the actual parent of the task would be the supervisor, as the supervisor is the one spawning it. We would list the supervisor as one of the `$ancestors` for the task, but the relationship between your code and the task is lost.\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.8, we now track the relationship between your code and the task via the `$callers` key in the process dictionary, which aligns well with the existing `$ancestors` key. Therefore, assuming the `Task.Supervisor` call above, we have:\r\n\r\n    [your code] -- calls --> [supervisor] ---- spawns --> [task]\r\n\r\nwhich means we store the following relationships:\r\n\r\n    [your code]              [supervisor] <-- ancestor -- [task]\r\n         ^                                                  |\r\n         |--------------------- caller ---------------------|\r\n\r\nWhen a task is spawned directly from your code, without a supervisor, then the process running your code will be listed under both `$ancestors` and `$callers`.\r\n\r\nThis small feature is very powerful. It allows instrumentation and monitoring tools to better track and relate the events happening in your system. This feature can also be used by tools like the \"Ecto Sandbox\". The \"Ecto Sandbox\" allows developers to run tests concurrently against the database, by using transactions and an ownership mechanism where each process explicitly gets a connection assigned to it. Without `$callers`, every time you spawned a task that queries the database, the task would not know its caller, and therefore it would be unable to know which connection was assigned to it. This often meant features that relies on tasks could not be tested concurrently. With `$callers`, figuring out this relationship is trivial and you have more tests using the full power of your machine.\r\n\r\n### 1.

Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Kernel] Expand `left..right` at compile time in more cases, which leads to improved performance under different scenarios, especially on `x in left..right` expressions\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix deps.loadpaths] Add `--no-load-deps` flag. This is useful for Rebar 3 compatibility\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Calendar] Fix for converting from negative iso days on New Year in a leap year\r\n  * [Kernel] Ensure `@spec`, `@callback`, `@type` and friends can be read accordingly\r\n  * [Module] Avoid warnings when using Module.eval_quoted in the middle of existing definitions\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix archive.build] Unload previous archive versions before building\r\n  * [mix format] Expand paths so mix format `path\\for\\windows.ex` works\r\n  * [mix test] Ensure that `--cover` displays correct coverage in an umbrella app\r\n\r\n## Checksums\r\n\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA1: eb328d3b071b33d80ad4cb4b3b203c1b2d7a5186\r\n  * Precompiled.zip SHA512: 807002481ae129fa1610a1facabe19765e2542397923d5c89e16b58f54870f2e444973e136d6b1207190b3117c03a37430860b6e3e6b7d59b3afb1b01852c6e3\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA1: 47ae4cea91a2da8ff040e346c059afccbdbffa13\r\n  * Docs.zip SHA512: 5b760a37e45640ab5816ad3ef2b581071e534fd0c409aa1a5348ee9a44980b099f54d66a3f9228be4ece1481a24b7109b1c9ac01d0aa0df4713fb0be1ca2de35"

        "body": "Elixir v1.7 is the last release to support Erlang/OTP 19. We recommend everyone to migrate to Erlang/OTP 20+.\r\n\r\n## Documentation metadata\r\n\r\nElixir v1.7 implements [EEP 48](http://erlang.org/eep/eeps/eep-0048.html). EEP 48 aims to bring documentation interoperability across all languages running on the Erlang VM. The documentation format proposed by EEP 48 also supports metadata, which is now fully exposed to Elixir developers:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n@moduledoc \"A brand new module\"\r\n@moduledoc authors: [\"Jane\", \"Mary\"], since: \"1.4.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassing metadata is supported on `@doc`, `@moduledoc` and `@typedoc`.\r\n\r\nTo access the new documentation format, developers should use `Code.fetch_docs/1`. The old documentation format is no longer available and the old `Code.get_docs/2` function will return `nil` accordingly.\r\n\r\nTools like IEx and ExDoc have been updated to leverage the new format and show relevant metadata to users. While Elixir allows any metadata to be given, those tools currently exhibit only `:deprecated` and `:since`. Other keys may be shown in the future.\r\n\r\n## The `__STACKTRACE__` construct\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 21.0 introduces a new way to retrieve the stacktrace that is lexically scoped and no longer relies on side-effects like `System.stacktrace/0` does. Before one would write:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ntry do\r\n  ... something that may fail ...\r\nrescue\r\n  e ->\r\n    log(e, System.stacktrace())\r\n    reraise(e, System.stacktrace())\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Elixir v1.7, this can be written as:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ntry do\r\n  ... something that may fail ...\r\nrescue\r\n  e ->\r\n    log(e, __STACKTRACE__)\r\n    reraise(e, __STACKTRACE__)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change may also yield performance improvements in the future, since the lexical scope allows us to track precisely when a stacktrace is used and we no longer need to keep references to stacktrace entries after the `try` construct finishes.\r\n\r\nOther parts of the exception system have been improved. For example, more information is provided in certain occurrences of `ArgumentError`, `ArithmeticError` and `KeyError` messages.\r\n\r\n## Erlang/OTP logger integration\r\n\r\nErlang/OTP 21 includes a new `:logger` module. Elixir v1.7 fully integrates with the new `:logger` and leverages its metadata system. The `Logger.Translator` mechanism has also been improved to export metadata, allowing custom Logger backends to leverage information such as:\r\n\r\n  * `:crash_reason` - a two-element tuple with the throw/error/exit reason as first argument and the stacktrace as second\r\n\r\n  * `:initial_call` - the initial call that started the process\r\n\r\n  * `:registered_name` - the process registered name as an atom\r\n\r\nWe recommend Elixir libraries that previously hooked into Erlang's `:error_logger` to hook into `Logger` instead, in order to support all current and future Erlang/OTP versions.\r\n\r\n## Other Logger improvements\r\n\r\nPreviously, Logger macros such as `debug`, `info`, and so on would always evaluate their arguments, even when nothing would be logged. From Elixir v1.7, the arguments are only evaluated when the message is logged.\r\n\r\nThe Logger configuration system also accepts a new option called `:compile_time_purge_matching` that allows you to remove log calls with specific compile-time metadata. For example, to remove all logger calls from application `:foo` with level lower than `:info`, as well as remove all logger calls from `Bar.foo/3`, you can use the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\nconfig :logger,\r\n  compile_time_purge_matching: [\r\n    [application: :foo, level_lower_than: :info],\r\n    [module: Bar, function: \"foo/3\"]\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ExUnit improvements\r\n\r\nExUnit has also seen its own share of improvements. Assertions such as `assert some_fun(arg1, arg2, arg3)` will now include the value of each argument in the failure report:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1) test function call arguments (TestOneOfEach)\r\n     lib/ex_unit/examples/one_of_each.exs:157\r\n     Expected truthy, got false\r\n     code: assert some_vars(1 + 2, 3 + 4)\r\n     arguments:\r\n\r\n         # 1\r\n         3\r\n\r\n         # 2\r\n         7\r\n\r\n     stacktrace:\r\n       lib/ex_unit/examples/one_of_each.exs:158: (test)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, failures in doctests are now colored and diffed.\r\n\r\nOn the `mix test` side of things, there is a new `--failed` flag that runs all tests that failed the last time they ran. Finally, coverage reports generated with `mix test --cover` include a summary out of the box:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGenerating cover results ...\r\n\r\nPercentage | Module\r\n-----------|--------------------------\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Exception.Any\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Adapters.Cowboy2.Stream\r\n   100.00% | Collectable.Plug.Conn\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Crypto.KeyGenerator\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Parsers\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Head\r\n   100.00% | Plug.Router.Utils\r\n   100.00% | Plug.RequestId\r\n       ... | ...\r\n-----------|--------------------------\r\n    77.19% | Total\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1.

Currently only the `:greek` context is supported\r\n  * [String] Support `:ascii` conversion in `String.upcase/2` and `String.downcase/2`\r\n  * [Time] Add `Time.add/3`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Assertions] Perform inclusive checks in `assert_in_delta`\r\n  * [ExUnit.Callbacks] Add `ExUnit.Callbacks.start_supervised!/2`\r\n  * [ExUnit.Case] Generate a random seed per test based on the test suite seed\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx.Autocomplete] Provide contextual autocompletion: `t Enum.` will autocomplete types, `b Enum` will autocomplete callbacks\r\n  * [IEx.CLI] Provide hints for developers when a bad host name is given to `--remsh`\r\n  * [IEx.Helpers] Automatically include specs when showing documentation for functions/macros\r\n  * [IEx.Helpers] Improve formatting of behaviours and typespecs by using the formatter\r\n  * [IEx.Helpers] Allow pattern matching and guard expressions when on `IEx.break!`\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n\r\n  * [Logger] Add `:discard_threshold` to Logger to help with message queue overflow\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix app.start] Add `--preload-modules` to `mix app.start`\r\n  * [mix archive.build] Allow `mix archive.build` to bundle dot files via an option\r\n  * [mix compile] Define a behavior for Mix compiler tasks and return diagnostics from compiler tasks\r\n  * [mix compile] Track struct dependencies between files and recompile them only if the struct changes\r\n  * [mix deps] Support `:system_env` option when specifying dependencies\r\n  * [mix format] Add a `mix format` task that formats the given files (or the files specified in a `.formatter.exs` file)\r\n  * [mix profile.eprof] Add a new task for time-based profiling with eprof\r\n  * [mix test] Run all functions in a describe block by giving the `file:line` the describe block starts\r\n  * [mix test] Report the top N slowest tests with the `--slowest N` flag\r\n  * [mix test] Report the number of doctests and tests separately\r\n  * [mix xref] Support `--include-siblings` in reports for umbrella support\r\n  * [mix xref] Add `mix xref graph --format stats`\r\n  * [mix xref] Add `--only-nodes` and `--label` filters to mix xref graph\r\n  * [mix xref] Add `mix xref deprecated` that shows the callsite of deprecated functions\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [CLI] Support path with spaces as argument to elixir.bat\r\n  * [Inspect] Properly handle minus signal for non-decimal negative integers\r\n  * [Integer] Do not raise on non-integer values in `is_odd`/`is_even`\r\n  * [Kernel] Solve a precedence issue between `&` and `|`, such as `[&Foo.bar/1 | &Baz.bat/2]`\r\n  * [Kernel] Do not load dynamic Elixir modules as `:in_memory` as this value is not officially supported by the code server. Instead, use an empty list, which is the same value used by Erlang.\r\n  * [Kernel] Validate variable struct name is atom when used in pattern matching\r\n  * [Kernel] No longer generate documentation for `defdelegate` functions automatically to avoid overriding previously specified `@doc`\r\n  * [Macro] Fix `Macro.to_string/2` for tuple calls, such as `alias Foo.{Bar, Baz}`\r\n  * [MapSet] Return valid MapSet when unioning a legacy MapSet\r\n  * [Regex] Return a leading empty space when splitting on empty pattern.

This makes the `split` operation consistent with the other operations in the `String` module\r\n  * [URI] Preserve empty fragments in `URI.parse/1`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix app.start] Improve the quality of reports if app fails to boot\r\n  * [mix cmd] Allow `mix cmd` to be invoked multiple times without marking it as executed\r\n  * [mix deps] Ensure optional dependencies in umbrella applications are loaded\r\n  * [mix deps.update] Ensure transitive new non-Hex dependencies are also fetched when a repo is updated\r\n  * [mix xref] Take compile dependencies with higher priority than runtime ones when building a graph\r\n  * [mix xref] Handle external files for xref callers and warnings\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [GenServer] Warn if `init/1` is not defined in `GenServer`. This brings GenServer closer to the implementation in OTP and aligns all behaviours to require the `init/1` callback\r\n  * [Inspect.Algebra] `surround/3` and `surround_many/6` are deprecated in favor of `container_doc/6`\r\n  * [Kernel] Specifying map types with variable keys without defining the type as required/optional is deprecated\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelCompiler] `files/2` and `files_to_path/3` are deprecated in favor of `compile/2` and `compile_to_path/3`\r\n  * [Kernel.ParallelRequire] `files/2` is deprecated in favor of `Kernel.ParallelCompiler.require/2`\r\n  * [Supervisor] The `:simple_one_for_one` strategy is deprecated in favor of `DynamicSupervisor`\r\n  * [Supervisor] Passing a list of args to `Supervisor.start_child/2` is deprecated in favor of `DynamicSupervisor`\r\n  * [Task.Supervisor] Passing `:restart` and `:shutdown` to `Task.Supervisor.start_link/2` is deprecated (it should be passed on start child instead)\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit.Formatter] `:case_started` and `:case_finished` events are deprecated in favor of `:module_started` and `:module_finished`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [Mix.Compilers.Erlang] Returning `{:ok, val} | :error` from custom Erlang compilers is deprecated in favor of `{:ok, val, warnings} | {:error, errors, warnings}`\r\n\r\n### 4. Deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Enum] `Enum.partition/2` is deprecated in favor of `Enum.split_with/2`\r\n  * [Keyword] `Keyword.replace/3` is deprecated in favor of `Keyword.fetch/2` and `Keyword.put/3`\r\n  * [Map] `Map.replace/3` is deprecated in favor of `Map.fetch/2` and `Map.put/3`\r\n  * [Macro] `Macro.unescape_tokens/1` and `Macro.unescape_tokens/2` are deprecated in favor of `Enum.map/2`\r\n  * [Range] Deprecate `Range.range?/1` in favor of pattern matching on `_ .. _`\r\n"

Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n\r\n  * [Calendar] Ensure `Calendar.ISO` raises a readable error when reaching up the year 10000 restriction\r\n  * [Calendar] Return `{:error, :invalid_time}` for wrong precision instead of crashing when parsing ISO dates\r\n  * [Enumerable] Raise `Protocol.UndefinedError` on bad functions in Enumerable implementation\r\n  * [File] Ensure recursive file operations raise on paths with null bytes (*security issue reported by Griffin Byatt*)\r\n  * [File] Support `:ram`/`:raw` files in `File.copy/2`\r\n  * [Inspect] Do not use colors when inspecting error messages\r\n  * [Kernel] Support guards on anonymous functions of zero arity\r\n  * [Kernel] Fix compilation of maps used as maps keys inside matches\r\n  * [Kernel] Ensure `do` clause in `with` is tail call optimizable\r\n  * [Module] `on_definition/6` callback receives body wrapped in a keyword list, such as `[do: body]`. This solves a bug where it was impossible to distinguish between a bodyless clause and a function that returns `nil`.\r\n  * [Path] Ensure recursive path operations raise on paths with null bytes (*security issue reported by Griffin Byatt*)\r\n  * [Protocol] Do not lose source compile info on protocol consolidation\r\n  * [Record] Properly escape quoted expressions passed to `defrecord`\r\n  * [Regex] Fix `inspect/2` for regexes with `/` terminator in them\r\n  * [Registry] Ensure `Registry.match/4` works with `:_` as key\r\n  * [Stream] Fix stream cycle over empty enumerable\r\n  * [String] Consider Unicode non-characters valid according to the specification in `String.valid?/1`\r\n  * [StringIO] Fix encoding and performance issues in `StringIO.get_until`\r\n  * [System] Raise on paths with null bytes in `System.cmd/2` and in `System.find_executable/1` (*security issue reported by Griffin Byatt*)\r\n  * [System] Raise on ill-formed environment variables (*security issue reported by Griffin Byatt*)\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n\r\n  * [ExUnit] Properly account failed tests when `setup_all` fails\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n\r\n  * [IEx] Skip autocompletion of module names that are invalid without being quoted\r\n  * [IEx] Skip autocompletion of functions with default arguments with `@doc false`\r\n  * [IEx] Do not start oldshell alongside IEx\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n\r\n  * [mix compile.elixir] Store multiple sources in case of module conflicts. This solves an issue where `_build` would get corrupted when compiling Elixir projects with module conflicts\r\n  * [mix compile.erlang] Do not silently discard Erlang compile errors\r\n  * [mix compile.erlang] Properly track `-compile` module attribute when specified as a list\r\n  * [mix compile.protocols] Ensure protocol implementations do not \"disappear\" when switching between applications in umbrella projects by having separate consolidation paths per project\r\n  * [mix compile.protocols] Do not raise when consolidating a protocol that was converted into a module\r\n\r\n### 3.

Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Access] Do not accept nils in `Access.key/1` and `Access.key/2` in favor of explicit default values (or Access.key!/1 if you expect the key to always be available)\r\n- [Float] Avoid multiple roundings in `Float.ceil/2`, `Float.floor/2` and `Float.round/2`\r\n- [Kernel] Don't crash in `macro_exported?/3` when dealing with Erlang modules\r\n- [Kernel] Ensure locals calls are rewritten when calling a local function or macro from inside a module\r\n- [Kernel] Annotate the context for variables as zero-arity funs in quotes\r\n- [Kernel.SpecialForms] Ensure comprehensions with guards and filters keep proper ordering,\r\n- [Kernel.SpecialForms] Produce meaningful warning when with's else clauses have no effect\r\n- [Macro] Wrap fn calls in parens in `Macro.to_string/2`\r\n- [Macro] Do not print aliases as keys inside keyword lists in `Macro.to_string/2`\r\n- [OptionParser] Support options in `OptionParser.to_argv/2` to ensure `:count` switches are correctly encoded\r\n- [Stream] Ensure `Stream.take/2` does not consume next element on `:suspend`\r\n- [String] Fix infinite recursion in `String.replace_leading/3` and `String.replace_trailing/3` when given an empty string\r\n- [Task] Fix `Task.shutdown/1,2` infinite block when task has no monitor\r\n- [Task] Ensure task cannot link after parents unlinks\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Fix a race condition in `assert_receive` where we would assert a message was not received but show it in the list of messages when the message is delivered right after the timeout value\r\n\r\n### IEx\r\n- [IEx.Helpers] Purge consolidated protocols before and after `recompile/0`\r\n\r\n### Mix\r\n- [Mix.Dep] Use `gmake` on FreeBSD instead of `make` when compiling make dependencies\r\n- [Mix.Project] Only copy files from source when they're newer than destination (for Windows machines)\r\n- [Mix.Task] Ensure non-recursive tasks inside umbrella are reenabled\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Enum] `Enum.partition/2` has been deprecated in favor of `Enum.split_with/2`\r\n- [System] Deprecate plural time units in favor of singular ones to align with future Erlang releases\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Using GenEvent to implement ExUnit formatters is deprecated. Please use the new `GenServer` based formatters instead\r\n\r\n### 4. Deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Access] `Access.key/1` is deprecated due to erratic behaviour for missing keys, please use Access.key/2 instead with proper default values\r\n- [Behaviour] The `Behaviour` module is deprecated. Callbacks may now be defined directly via the `@callback` attribute\r\n- [Enum] Deprecate `Enum.uniq/2` in favor of `Enum.uniq_by/2`\r\n- [Float] `Float.to_char_list/2` and `Float.to_string/2` are deprecated (use the :erlang functions if such conversions are desired)\r\n- [Kernel] Deprecate support for making private functions overridable. Overridable functions must always be public as they must be contracts\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if variable is used as a function call\r\n- [OptionParser] Deprecate aliases with multiple letters, such as `-abc`\r\n- [Set] Deprecate the `Set` module\r\n- [Stream] Deprecate `Stream.uniq/2` in favor of `Stream.uniq_by/2`\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n- [IEx.Helpers] `import_file/2` is deprecated in favor of `import_file_if_available/1`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix.Utils] `underscore/1` and `camelize/1` are deprecated\r\n"

        "body": "Official announcement: https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2016/06/21/elixir-v1-3-0-released/\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n- [EEx.Engine] Support an `init/1` function in engines that will return the initial buffer (defaults to an empty string)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Access] Add support for `Access.all/0`, `Access.elem/1`, `Access.key/2` and `Access.key!/1` for traversing nested data structures\r\n- [Calendar] Add `Calendar` and `Date`, `Time`, `NaiveDateTime` and `DateTime` types\r\n- [CLI] Add `--logger-otp-reports BOOL` and `--logger-sasl-reports BOOL` switches\r\n- [Compiler] Emit a summary of compilation errors when modules are missing\r\n- [Enum] Add `Enum.group_by/3` that allows developers to map on the value being grouped\r\n- [Enum] Make list values in maps returned by `Enum.group_by/2` and `Enum.group_by/3` preserve the order of the input enumerable instead of reversing it.\r\n- [Enum] Add `Enum.drop_every/2` that drops every `nth`, including the first one\r\n- [Exception] Suggest possible functions on `UndefinedFunctionError` for existing modules\r\n- [Exception] Warn if unknown fields are given to `raise/2`\r\n- [File] Support IO devices in `File.copy/3`\r\n- [GenServer] Raise a more meaningful exit if you try to `GenServer.call/3` yourself\r\n- [Inspect] Support `:base` option when inspecting binaries\r\n- [IO] Add `IO.warn/2` that will print a warning message with stacktrace and notify the compiler a warning was printed (in case --warnings-as-errors was enabled)\r\n- [Kernel] Support `generated: true` in quote\r\n- [Kernel] Support `Kernel.pop_in/1` and `Kernel.pop_in/2` for yanking a value from a nested data structure\r\n- [Kernel] Allow variable struct names when matching, for example, `%module{key: \"value\"} = struct`\r\n- [Kernel] Allow guards on the left side of `<-` in `for` and `with` special forms\r\n- [Kernel] Support `else` chunks in `with`\r\n- [Kernel] Track `{module, function, arity}` imports and warn on unused ones when such are specified in `:only`\r\n- [Kernel] Add `keyword/0` and `keyword/1` built-in types to typespecs\r\n- [Kernel] Add sigils for date (`~D[2015-04-17]`), time (`~T[08:00:00]`) and naive date times `~N[2015-04-17 08:00:00]`\r\n- [Kernel] Support `@enforce_keys` on `defstruct/1` to guarantee some keys are explicitly given when building structs\r\n- [OptionParser] Add support for `:count` switch type\r\n- [OptionParser] Add `parse!/2` and `parse_head!/2` that raise `OptionParser.ParseError` in case of errors\r\n- [Process] Add `Process.sleep/1`\r\n- [Range] `Range.range?/1` now checks the validity of a range.\r\n- [Regex] Support `:include_captures` in `Regex.split/3`\r\n- [String] Add `String.myers_difference/2` for calculating the difference between two strings\r\n- [System] Add `System.os_time/0` and `System.os_time/1`\r\n- [Typespec] Add support for `%{required(foo) => bar}` and `%{optional(foo) => bar}` forms (Erlang 19 only)\r\n- [Typespec] Add support for `@optional_callbacks` to mark certain that certain callbacks may be optionally implemented\r\n- [Typespec] Introduce `%{...}` to mean any map (Erlang 19 only)\r\n- [URI] Add `URI.merge/2`\r\n- [Version] Add `Version.parse!/1`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Show pinned variables on failed `assert ^left = right` and `assert match?(^left, right)` assertions\r\n- [ExUnit] Add `ExUnit.Case.register_attribute` which allow attributes to be cleaned up whenever a test is defined\r\n- [ExUnit] Add `ExUnit.Case.register_test` and support the ability to tag \"tests\" by type. This will allow projects like QuickCheck to change the wording in formatters to say \"10 properties\" instead of \"10 tests\"\r\n- [ExUnit] Support diffing of values when using `==` in `assert`\r\n- [ExUnit] Start running tests as soon as cases are loaded. This feature is enabled by default when running tests through Mix\r\n- [ExUnit] Raise a straight-forward error message in case a duplicate test name is defined\r\n- [ExUnit] Bump the default number of max cases to double of schedulers to support both IO and CPU bound tests\r\n- [ExUnit] Support for named setups in `setup` and `setup_all`\r\n- [ExUnit] Support for bundling tests together with `describe/2`\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n- [IEx] Add `nl/2` that loads a given module on a list of nodes\r\n- [IEx.Helpers] No longer restart applications on `recompile/1`\r\n- [IEx.Autocomplete] Improve IEx expand to handle functions after `&`\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n- [Logger] Introduce `Logger.reset_metadata/0,1`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix xref` and `mix compile.xref` that runs cross-reference checks, with the latter running after compilation by default\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix app.tree` and `mix deps.tree`\r\n- [Mix] Add `Mix.Task.rerun/2` that reenables and re-runs a task\r\n- [Mix] Integrate `OptionParser.ParseError` into Mix, automatically converting such exceptions into `Mix.Error` and embedding the task information\r\n- [Mix] Support `@preferred_cli_env` attribute when defining tasks\r\n- [Mix] Support `mix test --raise` that will raise when a test suite fails (instead of setting the exit code to 1)\r\n- [Mix] Enable rebar3 manager by default for Hex dependencies\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix escript.install` to install escripts\r\n- [Mix] Print stacktraces for `Mix.Error` when `MIX_DEBUG=1` is set\r\n- [Mix] Add a user friendly error for merge conflicts on `mix.lock`\r\n- [Mix] Track files between path dependencies. This means umbrella applications will no longer trigger full recompilation when a sibling changes. Instead it will only recompile the files affected by the sibling changes\r\n- [Mix] No longer print every file being compiled. Instead a generic \"Compiling N files (.ext)\" will be printed and files will only be logged in case they take more than 5 seconds to compile. This threshold can be customized by passing the `--long-compilation-threshold` flag and the previous behaviour can be reenabled by giving `--verbose` to `mix compile`\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix test --stale` that uses static analysis on source files to know which tests should run when source files changes. If any test file changes, it will also re-run. Changing a configuration file or the test helper will trigger a full recompilation\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Application] Ensure `Application.spec/2` returns nil for unknown applications\r\n- [GenServer] Ensures `cast/2` returns `:ok` if locally registered process is not found\r\n- [Inspect] Ensure binaries break into new lines when inspected\r\n- [Kernel] Do not choke on capture operator with argument above `&191`\r\n- [Kernel] Raise if `defstruct` is called multiple times\r\n- [Kernel] Ensure `Module.create/3` respects var/alias hygiene\r\n- [Kernel] Support non-literal ranges on the right side of `in/2`\r\n- [Macro] Fix `Macro.to_string/1` on a call of a capture argument, for example `&(&1).(:x)`\r\n- [OptionParser] Allow `OptionParser` to parse negative numbers\r\n- [Record] Fix `Record.is_record/2` when dealing with non-record tuples\r\n- [String] Ensure `strip` also removes non-breaking whitespaces (and ensure `split` still does not split on them)\r\n- [URI] Use square brackets for IPv6 in `URI.to_string/1`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Improve task not found message when Mix would include the not found task as a suggestion due to different casing\r\n- [Mix] Ignore lock revision when the lock is out of date when updating Mix dependencies. Before this fix, Git tags and branches in the lock file would erroneously take higher precedence than the one in `mix.exs`\r\n- [Mix] Only recompile empty Elixir files if they change instead of recompiling them on every run\r\n- [Mix] Ensure .app file is written in UTF-8 (this allows app descriptions to contain UTF-8 characters)\r\n- [Mix.Dep] Always specify the `:env` option internally for dependencies to avoid false positives in the dependency resolution\r\n- [Mix.Dep] Correctly detect conflict from cousin optional dependencies in the dependency resolution algorithm\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n- [Float] `Float.to_string/2` and `Float.to_char_list/2` has been soft-deprecated as Elixir will now attempt to print the shortest and most accurate representation by default. Developers can always fallback to `:erlang.float_to_binary/2` and `:erlang.float_to_list/2` if they need the previous functionality\r\n- [Kernel] `to_char_list` functions have been soft-deprecated in favor of `to_charlist`. This aligns with the naming conventions in both Erlang and Elixir\r\n- [String] The confusing `String.strip/2`, `String.lstrip/2` and `String.rstrip/2` API has been soft deprecated in favor of `String.trim/2`, `String.trim_leading/2` and `String.trim_trailing/2`\r\n- [String] The confusing `String.ljust/3` and `String.rjust/3` API has been soft deprecated in favor of `String.pad_leading/3` and `String.pad_trailing/3`\r\n- [Typespec] `char_list` is soft-deprecated in favor of `charlist`\r\n\r\n### 4. Deprecations\r\n\r\nThis release deprecates many APIs that have been soft-deprecated in previous Elixir versions.\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Dict] `Dict` is no longer a behaviour and its functions will be deprecated in upcoming releases\r\n- [Enum] Passing a dictionary to `Enum.group_by/3` is deprecated\r\n- [Kernel] `\\x{H*}` in strings/sigils/charlists is deprecated\r\n- [Kernel] Add deprecation for `defdelegate` list arguments and `:append_first` option. The previously undocumented and deprecated support for matching has been removed\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if a variable is assigned inside `case`/`if`/etc and used outside the block\r\n- [Keyword] `Keyword.size/1` is deprecated in favor of `Kernel.length/1`\r\n- [Map] `Map.size/1` is deprecated in favor of `Kernel.map_size/1`\r\n- [Regex] The option `/r` (for ungreedy) has been deprecated in favor of `/U`\r\n- [Set] `Set` is no longer a behaviour and its functions will be deprecated in upcoming releases\r\n- [String] `String.valid_character?/1` is deprecated in favor of `String.valid?/1` with pattern matching\r\n- [Task] `Task.find/2` is deprecated in favor of explicit message matching\r\n- [URI] Passing a non-map to `URI.decode_query/2` is deprecated\r\n"

Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Application] Add `spec/1` and `spec/2` to retrieve application specification\r\n- [Application] Add `get_application/1` to retrieve the application a given module belongs to\r\n- [Base] Optimize encode and decode operations about 10 times\r\n- [Enum] Use the faster and auto-seeding `:rand` instead of `:random` in `Enum.shuffle/1` and `Enum.random/1` and `Enum.take_random/2`\r\n- [Enum] Add `Enum.with_index/2`\r\n- [GenServer] Add `GenServer.stop/1` for shutting down servers reliably\r\n- [IO] Add `color` related functions to `IO.ANSI`\r\n- [Kernel] Support multiple aliases in `alias`, `import`, `require` and `use`. For example, `alias MyApp.{Foo, Bar, Baz}`\r\n- [Kernel] Add `struct!/2`. Similar to `struct/2` but raises on invalid keys\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if `@doc/@typedoc/@moduledoc` attributes are redefined\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if non-variables are used in `defdelegate/2` (as they have no effect)\r\n- [Kernel] Mark quoted expressions as generated, avoiding false positives on dialyzer\r\n- [Kernel] Allow variables as map keys on creation `%{key => value}` and on matches `%{^key => value}`\r\n- [Kernel] Allow the pin operator `^` in `fn` clauses and on the left side of `<-` in `for` comprehensions\r\n- [Kernel] Introduce `with` as a special form that allows matching on right side parameters\r\n- [Kernel] Warn when right hand side of `->` does not provide any expression\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if the Elixir was compiled with a different endianness than the one currently available at runtime\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if a variable is used after being defined exclusively in a nested context\r\n- [Kernel] Warn if piping into an expression without parentheses\r\n- [Macro] Add `Macro.traverse/4` that performs pre and post-walk at once\r\n- [Macro] Add `Macro.camelize/1` and `Macro.underscore/1`\r\n- [Process] Add `Process.get_keys/0`\r\n- [Stream] Add `Stream.with_index/2`\r\n- [String] Introduce `String.replace_{prefix,suffix,leading,trailing}/2`. The first two will replace only the first occurrence of the given match in string. The last two will replace all occurrences of the given match\r\n- [String] Support `String.normalize/2` and `String.equivalent?/2` that perform NFD and NFC normalization\r\n- [System] Add `System.time_offset`, `System.monotonic_time`, `System.system_time`, `System.convert_time_unit` and `System.unique_integer`\r\n- [System] Allow `System.cmd/3` to remove variables by specifying nil values\r\n- [Task] Add `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/1/3` that spawns a supervised task without linking to the caller process\r\n- [Task] Introduce `Task.yield_many/2`\r\n- [Task] Raise an error when a task is queried from a non-owning process (instead of waiting forever)\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Allow one test to raise multiple errors. The goal is to enable tools in the ecosystem to emit multiple failure reports from the same test\r\n- [ExUnit] Support `@tag report: [:foo, :bar]` which will include the values for tags `:foo` and `:bar` whenever a test fails\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n- [IEx] Allow `IEX_WITH_WERL` to be set on Windows to always run on WERL mode\r\n- [IEx] Display type docs for `t(Module.type)` and `t(Module.type/arity)`\r\n- [IEx] Add `i/1` helper that prints information about any data type\r\n- [IEx] Show source code snippet whenever there is a request to pry a given process\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n- [Logger] Add file to logger metadata\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Cache and always consolidate protocols\r\n- [Mix] Add `warn_test_pattern` to `mix test` that will warn on potentially misconfigured test files\r\n- [Mix] Introduce `MIX_QUIET` environment variable that configures the underlying Mix task to output only error messages\r\n- [Mix] Introduce `MIX_DEBUG` environment variable that prints information about the task being run\r\n- [Mix] Validate git options and warn on conflicting ref, branch or tags\r\n- [Mix] New umbrella applications will now share configuration and build files\r\n- [Mix] Add experimental support for Rebar 3\r\n- [Mix] Do not warn when an optional dependency has a conflicting `:only` option with another dependency\r\n- [Mix] Raise readable error message when parsertools is not available\r\n- [Mix] Add `--build` flag to `mix deps.clean DEP` to only remove artifacts from `_build`\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Kernel\r\n- [Access] Improve error messages when using Access on non-valid key-value structures\r\n- [Kernel] Raise when conflicting `:only` and `:except` are given to import\r\n- [Kernel] Change `__ENV__.file` if `@file` is set for the given function\r\n- [Kernel] Make `Kernel.ParallelRequire` aware of `:warning_as_errors`\r\n- [Kernel] Improve error message for invalid `do`/`do:`\r\n- [Macro] Ensure `Macro.to_string/2` respects operator precedence when using the access operator\r\n- [Path] Do not crash when expanding paths that go beyond the root, for example, `Path.expand(\"/../..\")`\r\n- [String] Ensure `UnicodeConversionError` does not contain invalid string in its error message\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n- [IEx] Do not start apps on `recompile` helper if `--no-start` was given\r\n- [IEx] Avoid copying of data when evaluating every expression in IEx\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Always run non-recursive tasks at the umbrella root\r\n- [Mix] Ensure rebar projects work on directory names that contain non-latin characters\r\n- [Mix] Ignore directories inside `apps` in umbrellas that do not have a `mix.exs` file\r\n- [Mix] Ensure Mix can be used with path dependencies where the app name is different than the path basename\r\n- [Mix] Ensure dependencies won't crash when updating from a git repository to a hex repository and the git version did not respect SemVer\r\n- [Mix] Do not run remote converger if dependencies have diverged\r\n- [Mix] Ensure umbrella dependencies across all environments are loaded on parent deps.get/deps.update\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Include file and line in all compilation errors for doctests\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Kernel\r\n- [Dict] `Dict` and `HashDict` are soft deprecated in favor of `Map`\r\n- [Keyword] `Keyword.size/1` is deprecated in favor of `length/1`\r\n- [Map] `Map.size/1` is deprecated in favor of `map_size/1`\r\n- [Set] `Set` and `HashSet` are soft deprecated in favor of `MapSet`\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] `Mix.Utils.camelize/1` and `Mix.Utils.underscore/1` are soft deprecated in favor of `Macro.camelize/1` and `Macro.underscore/1`\r\n"

        "body": "Official announcement: https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2015/09/28/elixir-v1-1-0-released/\r\n\r\n### 1. Enhancements\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Application] Add `Application.fetch_env!/2`, `Application.loaded_applications/0` and `Application.started_applications/0`\r\n- [CLI] Add support for `--werl` in Windows bash-like shells\r\n- [Dict] Add `Dict.get_and_update/3` which behaves similar to the now deprecated Access protocol\r\n- [Dict] Add `Dict.get_lazy/3`, `Dict.pop_lazy/3` and `Dict.put_new_lazy/3`\r\n- [Enum] Add `Enum.random/1`, `Enum.take_random/2`, `Enum.min_max/1`, `Enum.min_max_by/2`, `Enum.reverse_slice/3`, `Enum.reduce_while/3`, `Enum.dedup/1` and `Enum.dedup_by/2`\r\n- [Enum] Inline common map usage in `Enum` functions for performance\r\n- [File] Add `File.lstat/1` and `File.lstat/1` that works like `File.stat/1` but is able to return symlink information (i.e. it does not traverse symlinks)\r\n- [File] Add `File.rename/2`\r\n- [Integer] Add `Integer.digits/2` and `Integer.undigits/2`\r\n- [Inspect] Add the `:safe` option to `inspect/2` and make it safe by default, meaning failures while inspecting won't trigger other failures. Instead, it will be wrapped in an exception which is properly formatted\r\n- [IO] Support fenced code blocks on `IO.ANSI.Docs`\r\n- [GenServer] Add `GenServer.whereis/1` that expands `GenServer` dispatches into a proper pid\r\n- [Kernel] No longer include `:crypto` and `:syntax_tools` as dependencies. The former is only needed if you have encrypted debug info (therefore you can add `:crypto` as a dependency manually) and the latter is no longer used\r\n- [Kernel] Raise when `var.Alias` syntax is used and it does not expand to an atom at compile time (previously it emitted warnings)\r\n- [Kernel] Improve generation of argument names for function signatures\r\n- [Kernel] `::/2` is now a special form\r\n- [Kernel] Warn when a variable with underscore is used\r\n- [Kernel] Allow underscores in binary, octal and hex literals\r\n- [Kernel] Warn when module attributes, variables, strings and numbers are used in code but the expression has no effect\r\n- [Kernel] Support `\\uXXXX` and `\\u{X*}` in strings and char lists to map to Unicode codepoints\r\n- [List] Add `List.keytake/3`\r\n- [Module] Improve name inference for function signatures in documentation metadata\r\n- [Process] Add `Process.hibernate/3`\r\n- [Process] Allow a list of specs in `Process.info/2`\r\n- [Set] Introduce `MapSet` data type. This new data type uses maps behind the scenes and is useful for storing a dozens of items in Erlang 17. In future versions when maps efficiently support large collections, it is meant to be the main Set abstraction in Elixir\r\n- [Stream] Add `Stream.dedup/1`, `Stream.dedup_by/2` and `Stream.transform/4`\r\n- [String] Support calculation of the jaro distance between strings (usually names) via `String.jaro_distance/2`. This is used by Mix to support \"Did you mean?\" feature when a task does not exist\r\n- [String] Add `String.splitter/3` that splits strings as a stream\r\n- [StringIO] `StringIO.flush/1` was added to flush the output of a StringIO device\r\n- [Task] Introduce `Task.yield/2` and `Task.shutdown/2` to check if a task is still executing and shutdown otherwise\r\n- [Tuple] Add `Tuple.append/2`\r\n- [URI] Default ports were added for \"ws\" and \"wss\" schemas\r\n- [URI] Add `URI.to_string/1`\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n- [EEx] Add `:trim` option to EEx that automatically trims the left side of `<%` and right side `%>` if only spaces and new lines preceed/follow them\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Add number of skipped tests to `ExUnit` output\r\n- [ExUnit] Make timeout configurable for the whole test suite via the `:timeout` configuration\r\n- [ExUnit] Allow moduledoc to be filtered/skipped in doctests\r\n- [ExUnit] Provide built-in log capturing functionality\r\n- [ExUnit] Allow `assert_receive_timeout` and `refute_receive_timeout` to be configured in the ExUnit application\r\n- [ExUnit] Allow tests to be skipped with `@tag :skip` or `@tag skip: \"reason\"`\r\n- [ExUnit] Add tests without implementation (missing the do block) which automatically fail. Such tests are also automatically tagged as `:not_implemented`, allowing them to be skipped\r\n- [ExUnit] Increase by default stacktrace depth to 20 (this value is also configurable)\r\n- [ExUnit] Improve formatting on `assert_raise` errors for message mismatch\r\n- [ExUnit] Improve formatting on `assert_receive` when using pinned variables\r\n\r\n#### IEx\r\n- [IEx] Support `IEx.pry` with `--remsh` for remote debugging\r\n- [IEx] Add `b/1` helper that shows documentation for behaviour modules and its callback functions\r\n- [IEx] Provide tab completion for aliases and allow aliases like `Foo.Bar.Baz` to autocomplete even if `Foo.Bar` is not defined\r\n- [IEx] Provide a `pid/3` helper for buildings pids from numbers\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n- [Logger] Support printing pids and refs in Logger metadata\r\n- [Logger] Allow Logger metadata to be removed from pdict by setting it to `nil`\r\n- [Logger] Add application configuration `translator_inspect_opts` for logger to customize how state and message are formatted when translating OTP errors and reports\r\n- [Logger] Automatically include the current application in metadata when compiled via Mix\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Check Elixir version right after archive installation and provide feedback if there is a mismatch\r\n- [Mix] Allow rebar dependencies with `mix.exs` to be compiled with Mix\r\n- [Mix] Allow rebar dependencies to be specified via `:path`\r\n- [Mix] Also consider subdirectories in `config` directory for `Mix.Project.config_files/0`\r\n- [Mix] Allow dynamic configuration in Mix projects by storing config in an agent\r\n- [Mix] Support rebar3 style Git refs in `rebar.config` files\r\n- [Mix] Only recompile compile time dependencies in mix projects. This should considerably speed up recompilation times in Elixir projects\r\n- [Mix] Warn when configuring an application that is not available\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix profile.fprof` for easy code profiling\r\n- [Mix] Abort when dependencies have conflicting `:only` definitions\r\n- [Mix] Fully recompile projects if Elixir or SCM changes\r\n- [Mix] Allow checksum to be checked on archive install via `--sha512` option\r\n- [Mix] Add `mix local.public_keys` to safely manage installation of Hex and Rebar dependencies\r\n\r\n### 2. Bug fixes\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [CLI] Ensure Logger messages are flushed when executing commands\r\n- [Code] `:delegate_locals_to` failed to delegate to the chosen module in many situations and messed up stacktraces. This option has therefore been replaced by imports\r\n- [Code] Store the documentation line in the metadata returned by `Code.get_docs/2`\r\n- [Exception] Do not fail when calculating an exception message, even if the message is invalid\r\n- [File] Ensure `File.touch/2` and `File.stat/2` receive and return universal times. Previously they would work with local times which are not monotonically increasing, which could present issues on scripts. If the times are being shown to the user, `time: :local` can be given as argument\r\n- [Float] Support complete scientific notation in `Float.parse/1`\r\n- [Kernel] Do not expand `in/2` argument in module body\r\n- [Kernel] Throw syntax error for undefind atom/alias syntax `:foo.Bar`\r\n- [Kernel] Improve error message when we can't compile because the target directory is not writeable\r\n- [Kernel] Allow capture of non-symbolic operators like `&and/2`, `&not/1` and others\r\n- [Kernel] Raise if heredoc terminal is accidentally found in the middle of a line without escaping\r\n- [Kernel] Don't warn on missing imports if nothing was imported\r\n- [Kernel] Raise if arity bigger than 255 is given to capture operator\r\n- [Macro] Properly convert captures in `Macro.to_string/1`\r\n- [Module] Do not accept non-Elixir module names in `Module.split/1`\r\n- [Protocol] Guarantee that derived protocols go through `Any` instead of `Map`\r\n- [Range] Restrict ranges to integers to fix diverse bugs of values being included in the range when they should not (false positives)\r\n- [Regex] Fix splitting of empty strings with regexes when trim is set to `true`. Now both `String.split/3` and `Regex.split/3` return an empty list when called with an empty string and trim is enabled\r\n- [Regex] Fix `Regex.replace/4` so it doesn't discard escape characters\r\n- [Stream] Ensure suspending `Stream.flat_map/2` and `Stream.transform/3` does not consume unecessary items from the given enumerable\r\n\r\n#### EEx\r\n- [EEx] Allow EEx interpolation to also apply inside quotations `<%%= ... %>`\r\n\r\n#### ExUnit\r\n- [ExUnit] Skipped tests now correctly count towards the total of tests in the result returned by `ExUnit.run/0`\r\n- [ExUnit] Fix a bug where failures when inspecting data structure or retrieving error messages could bring the whole ExUnit runner down\r\n- [ExUnit] Do not change the semantics of evaluated code with `assert`/`refute`. For example, from now on, `assert nil = some_expr()` will now raise as expected, as the expression still evaluates to a falsy value\r\n- [ExUnit] Report proper line number for doctest failures\r\n\r\n#### Logger\r\n- [Logger] Include metadata in `Logger.log/3`, use `Logger.bare_log/3` for runtime-only, with no metadata behaviour\r\n\r\n#### Mix\r\n- [Mix] Use the safer `https` protocol instead of `git` for `:github` dependencies\r\n- [Mix] Ensure automatic protocol consolidation via `:consolidate_protocols` is triggered in umbrella apps\r\n- [Mix] Do not raise if wildcard given to `import_config` does not match any file\r\n- [Mix] Applications with `:build_embedded` set to true require explicit compilation step\r\n- [Mix] Also remove consolidated protocols on `mix clean`\r\n- [Mix] Ensure `--exclude` in `mix test` concatenates with test helper excludes\r\n\r\n### 3. Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Behaviour] The module `Behaviour` is deprecated. Instead of `defcallback`, one can simply use `@callback`. Instead of `defmacrocallback`, one can simply use `@macrocallback`\r\n- [Enum] `Enum.uniq/2` is deprecated in favor of `Enum.uniq_by/2`\r\n- [Kernel] `\\x` inside strings and charlists is deprecated in favor of `\\uXXXX` and `\\u{X*}`. The values emitted by `\\x` are unfortunately wrong (they should be bytes but currently it emits codepoints). `\\u` is meant to correctly map to codepoints and `\\x` will be fixed in the future to map to bytes\r\n- [Regex] Ungreedy option `r` is deprecated in favor of `U` (which is standard in regular expressions in other languages)\r\n\r\n### 4. Deprecations\r\n\r\n#### Elixir\r\n- [Access] Implementing the Access protocol is deprecated. The Access protocol relies on the code server in development and test mode (when protocol consolidation is not applied) and it generated a bottleneck when working with multiple processes and the Access protocol was invoked hundreds of times (which is not uncommon). Note the `Access` module and the `opts[key]` syntax are not affected and they are not deprecated, only the underlying protocol dispatch\r\n- [Kernel] `?\\xHEX` is deprecated in favor of `0xHEX`. There is no situation where the former should be used in favor of the latter and the latter is always cleaner\r\n- [Kernel] Giving `as: true | false` to `alias/2` and `require/2` have been deprecated (it was undocumented behaviour)\r\n- [String] Passing an empty string to `starts_with?`, `contains?` and `ends_with?` had dubious behaviour and have been deprecated to help developers identify possible bugs in their source code\r\n"

This fixes a bug where CRLF were being ignored and is also going to improve performance\n- [Logger] Handle `:undefined` arity in `Logger.Translator` (we get :undefined when a temporary worker of a `simple_one_for_one` supervisor crashes)\n- [Mix] Ensure config is escaped before being injected into escripts. This fixes a bug where escripts failed to build when containing values like maps in config files\n- [Mix] Ensure we properly underscore acronyms followed by paths, for example, `HTTP.Foo`\n- [Stream] Ensure `Stream.flat_map/2` does not consume more items than necessary when piped to another `Stream.flat_map/2` that halts in the inner stream\n- [Version] Fix `to_string` for versions with numeric pre releases\n"

        "body": "### Enhancements\n- [ExUnit] Add `on_exit/1` callbacks that are guaranteed to run once the test process exits and always in another process\n- [Kernel] Store documentation in the abstract code to avoid loading them when the module is loaded\n- [Kernel] Add `get_in/2`, `put_in/3`, `update_in/3` and `get_and_update_in/3` to handle nested data structure operations\n- [Kernel] Add `get_in/1`, `put_in/2`, `update_in/2` and `get_and_update_in/2` to handle nested data structure operations via paths\n- [Mix] Add `Mix.Config` to ease definition of configuration files\n- [Mix] Add `mix loadconfig` task that can be called multiple times to load external configs\n- [Mix] Support `--config` option on `mix run`\n- [Mix] Support `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` on Mix url commands\n- [Mix] Support `--names` options in `mix help` which emit only names (useful for autocompletion)\n- [Protocol] Add `Protocol.consolidate/2`, `Protocol.consolidated?/1` and a `mix compile.protocols` task for protocol consolidation\n- [Protocol] Add `Protocol.derive/3` for runtime deriving of a struct\n- [String] Add `String.chunk/2`\n- [Struct] Add support for `@derive` before `defstruct/2` definitions\n\n### Bug fixes\n- [File] `File.rm` now consistently deletes read-only across operating systems\n- [Kernel] Ensure Mix `_build` structure works on Windows when copying projects\n- [Kernel] Ensure `1.0E10` (with uppercase E) is also valid syntax\n- [Mix] Fix `mix do` task for Windows' powershell users\n- [Path] Fix `Path.absname(\"/\")` and `Path.expand(\"/\")` to return the absolute path `\"/\"`.\n\n### Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\n- [Kernel] `size/1` is deprecated, please use `byte_size/1` or `tuple_size/1` instead\n- [ExUnit] `teardown/2` and `teardown_all/2` are deprecated in favor of `on_exit/1` callbacks\n\n### Deprecations\n- [Access] `Access.access/2` is deprecated in favor of `Access.get/2`\n- [Dict] `Dict.Behaviour` is deprecated in favor of `Dict`\n- [Kernel] `Application.Behaviour`, `GenEvent.Behaviour`, `GenServer.Behaviour` and `Supervisor.Behaviour` are deprecated in favor of `Application`, `GenEvent`, `GenServer` and `Supervisor`\n- [Kernel] `defexception/3` is deprecated in favor of `defexception/1`\n- [Kernel] `raise/3` is deprecated in favor of `reraise/2`\n- [Kernel] `set_elem/3` is deprecated in favor of `put_elem/3`\n- [Kernel] Passing an atom `var!/1` is deprecated, variables can be built dynamically with `Macro.var/2`\n- [Mix] Exceptions that define a `:mix_error` field to be compatible with Mix are no longer supported. Instead please provide a `:mix` field and use `Mix.raise/1` and `Mix.raise/2`\n\n### Backwards incompatible changes\n- [Access] `Kernel.access/2` no longer exists and the `Access` protocol now requires `get/2` (instead of `access/2`) and `get_and_update/3` to be implemented\n- [Kernel] Retrieving docs as `module.__info__(:docs)` is no longer supported, please use `Code.get_docs/2` instead\n- [Kernel] `Code.compiler_options/1` no longer accepts custom options, only the ones specified by Elixir (use mix config instead)\n- [Mix] `mix new` no longer generates a supevision tree by default, please pass `--sup` instead\n- [Task] Tasks are automatically linked to callers and a failure in the task will crash the caller directly\n"

This means changing an `.eex` file will no longer recompile the whole project only the files that depend directly on it\n- [Mix] Support application configurations in `config/config.exs` which can be customized by specifying your own `:config_path`\n- [Mix] Support user-wide configuration with `~/.mix/config.exs`\n- [Mix] `mix help` now uses ANSI formatting to print guides\n- [Regex] Support functions in `Regex.replace/4`\n- [String] Support `:parts` in `String.split/3`\n\n### Bug fixes\n- [Code] Ensure we don't lose the caller stacktrace on code evaluation\n- [IEx] Exit signals now exits the IEx evaluator and a new one is spawned on its place\n- [IEx] Ensure we don't prune too much stacktrace when reporting failures\n- [IEx] Fix an issue where `iex.bat` on Windows was not passing the proper parameters forward\n- [Kernel] Ensure modules defined on root respect defined aliases\n- [Kernel] Do not wrap single lists in `:__block__`\n- [Kernel] Ensure emitted beam code works nicely with dialyzer\n- [Kernel] Do not allow a module named `Elixir` to be defined\n- [Kernel] Create remote funs even if mod is a variable in capture `&mod.fun/arity`\n- [Kernel] Improve compiler message when duplicated modules are detected\n- [Mix] Generate `.gitignore` for `--umbrella` projects\n- [Mix] Verify if a git dependency in deps has a proper git checkout and clean it automatically when it doesn't\n- [Mix] Ensure `mix test` works with `IEx.pry/0`\n- [System] Convert remaining functions in System to rely on char data\n\n### Soft deprecations (no warnings emitted)\n- [Application] `use Application.Behaviour` is deprecated in favor of `use Application`\n- [Exception] `exception.message` is deprecated in favor `Exception.message/1` for retrieving exception messages\n- [Kernel] `is_exception/1`, `is_record/1` and `is_record/2` are deprecated in favor of `Exception.exception?1`, `Record.record?/1` and `Record.record?/2`\n- [Mix] `Mix.project/0` is deprecated in favor of `Mix.Project.config/0`\n- [Process] `Process.spawn/1`, `Process.spawn/3`, `Process.spawn_link/1`, `Process.spawn_link/3`, `Process.spawn_monitor/1`, `Process.spawn_monitor/3`, `Process.send/2` and `Process.self/0` are deprecated in favor of the ones in `Kernel`\n\n### Deprecations\n- [IEx] IEx.Options is deprecated in favor of `IEx.configure/1` and `IEx.configuration/0`\n- [Kernel] `lc` and `bc` comprehensions are deprecated in favor of `for`\n- [Macro] `Macro.safe_terms/1` is deprecated\n- [Process] `Process.delete/0` is deprecated\n- [Regex] Deprecate `:global` option in `Regex.split/3` in favor of `parts: :infinity`\n- [String] Deprecate `:global` option in `String.split/3` in favor of `parts: :infinity`\n\n### Backwards incompatible changes\n- [ExUnit] `ExUnit.Test` and `ExUnit.TestCase` has been converted to structs\n- [ExUnit] The test and callback context has been converted to maps\n- [Kernel] `File.Stat`, `HashDict`, `HashSet`, `Inspect.Opts`, `Macro.Env`, `Range`, `Regex` and `Version.Requirement` have been converted to structs. This means `is_record/2` checks will no longer work, instead, you can pattern match on them using `%Range{}` and similar\n- [URI] The `URI.Info` record has now become the `URI` struct\n- [Version] The `Version.Schema` record has now become the `Version` struct\n"

Instead, they mark the dependencies which are going to be automatically compiled next time `deps.check` is invoked (which is done automatically by most mix tasks). This means users should have a better workflow when migrating in between environments\n\n### Deprecations\n- [Kernel] `//` for default arguments is deprecated in favor of `\\\\`\n- [Kernel] Using `%` for sigils is deprecated in favor of `~`. This is a soft deprecation, no warnings will be emitted for it in this release\n- [Kernel] Using `^` inside function clause heads is deprecated, please use a guard instead\n\n### Backwards incompatible changes\n- [ExUnit] `CaptureIO` returns an empty string instead of nil when there is no capture\n- [Version] The `Version` module now only works with SemVer. The functions `Version.parse/1` and `Version.parse_requirement/1` now return `{:ok,res} | :error` for the cases you want to handle non SemVer cases manually. All other functions will trigger errors on non semantics versions\n"

The goal is to group all runtime statistic related helpers into a single module\n- [Kernel] `binary_to_term/1`, `binary_to_term/2`, `term_to_binary/1` and `term_to_binary/2` are deprecated in favor of their counterparts in the `:erlang` module\n- [Kernel] `//` for default arguments is deprecated in favor of `\\\\`.

To get polymorphism, use the functions in `Dict` instead\n- [File] `File.cp/3` and `File.cp_r/3` no longer carry Unix semantics where the function behaves differently if the destination is an existing previous directory or not. It now always copies source to destination, doing it recursively in the latter\n- [IEx] IEx now loads the `.iex.exs` file instead of `.iex`\n- [Kernel] Remove `**` from the list of allowed operators\n- [Kernel] Limit sigils delimiters to one of the following: `<>`, `{}`, `[]`, `()`, `||`, `//`, `\"` and `'`\n- [Range] `Range` is no longer a record, instead use `first .. last` if you need pattern matching\n- [Set] Implementations of `difference/2`, `disjoint?/2`, `equal?/2`, `intersection/2`, `subset?/2` and `union/2` in `HashSet` are no longer polymorphic.

Previously, a variable defined in a case/receive head clauses would leak to the outer scope. This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.\n- [Kernel] Deprecate `__FILE__` in favor of `__DIR__` or `__ENV__.file`\n\n### Backwards incompatible changes\n- [GenFSM] GenServer now stops on unknown event/sync_event requests\n- [GenServer] GenServer now stops on unknown call/cast requests\n- [Kernel] Change how `->` is represented in AST. Now each clause is represented by its own AST node which makes composition easier. See commit 51aef55 for more information.\n"

Please see `Enumerable` docs for more info\n- [Enum] Deprecate `Enum.chunks/2`, `Enum.chunks/4` and `Enum.chunks_by/2` in favor of `Enum.chunk/2`, `Enum.chunk/4` and `Enum.chunk_by/2`\n- [File] `File.binstream!/3` is deprecated. Simply use `File.stream!/3` which is able to figure out if `stream` or `binstream` operations should be used\n- [Macro] `Macro.extract_args/1` is deprecated in favor of `Macro.decompose_call/1`\n\n### Backwards incompatible changes\n- [Enum] Behaviour of `Enum.drop/2` and `Enum.take/2` has been switched when given negative counts\n- [Enum] Behaviour of `Enum.zip/2` has been changed to stop as soon as the first enumerable finishes\n- [Enum] `Enumerable.reduce/3` protocol has changed to support suspension. Please see `Enumerable` docs for more info\n- [Mix] Require `:escript_main_module` to be set before generating escripts\n- [Range] `Range.Iterator` protocol has changed in order to work with the new `Enumerable.reduce/3`. Please see `Range.Iterator` docs for more info\n- [Stream] The `Stream.Lazy` structure has changed to accumulate functions and accumulators as we go (its inspected representation has also changed)\n- [Typespec] `when` clauses were moved to the outer part of the spec and should be in the keywords format. So `add(a, b) when is_subtype(a, integer) and is_subtype(b, integer) :: integer` should now be written as `add(a, b) :: integer when a: integer, b: integer`\n"

Previously, if a function returned `quote do: a = 1`, another function from the same module could access it as `quote do: a`. This has been fixed and the variables must be explicitly shared with `var!(a, __MODULE__)`\n- [Mix] Umbrella apps now treat children apps as dependencies. This means all dependencies will be checked out in the umbrela `deps` directory. On upgrade, child apps need to point to the umbrella project by setting `deps_path: \"../../deps_path\", lockfile: \"../../mix.lock\"` in their project config\n- [Process] `Process.group_leader/2` args have been reversed so the \"subject\" comes first\n- [Protocol] Protocol no longer dispatches to `Number`, but to `Integer` and `Float`\n"
